Installation instructions for fontserver

1 - set DefaultFSConfigFile to point to the correct place, if the default
    is not what you want.

    an example config file is in ./config

2 - modify the file named by DefaultFsConfigFile so the 'catalogue'
	parameter points to a set of valid font directories.

At this point the test programs should work.  Start the font server
	(xfs &) and try some tests.  Most of the clients take
	a command line switch of where to find the server, and
	FSlib understands the environment variable FONTSERVER.
	The format is the same as Xlib, (ie, hostname:server_number).

See mit/doc/fontserver:

./doc
	various pieces of documentation on the font server and associated
	software:

	FSlib.doc	- short summary of the FSlib functions and their args
	test_progs	- description of the clients & test programs
	design.ms	- troff source of fontserver design overview

Tested font formats.

The fontserver has been tested with PCF, Speedo, SNF and BDF formats.

Tested environments:

the fontserver and clients have been built & tested on SPARC running
4.x and a DECstation 3100 running V4.0.  it should work ok on any 32
bit UNIX w/ BSD sockets.
