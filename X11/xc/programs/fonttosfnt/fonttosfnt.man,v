.TH FONTTOSFNT 1 __vendorversion__
.SH NAME
fonttosfnt \- Wrap a bitmap font in a sfnt (TrueType) wrapper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fonttosfnt
[
.I options
]
.B \-o
.I file.ttf
[
.B \-\-
]
.IR font ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Wrap a bitmap font or a set of bitmap fonts in a sfnt (TrueType or
OpenType) wrapper.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
Be verbose.
.TP 
.B \-c
Do not crop glyphs.  This usually increases file size, but may
sometimes yield a modest decrease in file size for small character
cell fonts (terminal fonts).
.TP 
.B \-b
Write byte-aligned glyph data.  By default, bit-aligned data is
written, which yields a smaller file size.
.TP
.B \-r
Do not reencode fonts.  By default, fonts are reencoded to Unicode
whenever possible.
.TP 
.BI \-g " n"
Set the type of scalable glyphs that we write.  If
.I n
is 0, no scalable glyphs are written; this is legal but confuses
most current software.  If
.I n
is 1, a single scalable glyph (the undefined glyph) is written; this
is recommended, but triggers a bug in current versions of
.BR FreeType .
If
.I n
is 2 (the default), a sufficiently high number of blank glyphs are
written, which works with
.B FreeType
but increases file size.
.TP 
.BI \-m " n"
Set the type of scalable metrics that we write.  If
.I n
is 0, no scalable metrics are written, which may or may not be legal.
If
.I n
is 1, full metrics for a single glyph are written, and only left
sidebearing values are written for the other glyphs.  If
.I n
is 2, scalable metrics for all glyphs are written, which increases
file size and is not recommended.  The default is 1.
.TP
.B \-\-
End of options.
.SH BUGS
Some of the font-level values, notably sub- and superscript positions,
are dummy values.
.SH SEE ALSO
X(7), Xserver(1), Xft(3x).
