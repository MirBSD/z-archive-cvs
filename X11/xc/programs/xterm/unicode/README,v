@revert to xterm-200-based (plus fix an openbsd glitch)
xterm-215-based does not work correctly:
* uxterm does not honour its class (e.g. my font is too small)
* utmp is never updated

These are some scripts and datafiles used for generating tables used in the
experimental UTF-8 implementation in xterm.

To run the convmap.pl script, you will need a copy of UnicodeData-Latest.txt
which is currently available as

         ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt

It is a large file (~877kb), so it is not included in this distribution.

convmap.pl is used to generate ../keysym2ucs.c, e.g.,

	./convmap.pl >../keysym2ucs.c

keysym.map is input data for convmap.pl


The make-precompose.sh script makes the precompose.c file, which is used to
handle canonical composition. This also needs UnicodeData-Latest.txt. It uses
precompose.c.head and precompose.c.tail as templates.

@Import xterm-215 (latest from Tom Dickey)
XFree86 4.6.0 had xterm-213 with no diffs,
so we only need to care about both obsd and
mbsd local diffs
