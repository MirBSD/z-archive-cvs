@The geometry component of a keyboard mapping specifies primarily the geometry of
the keyboard. It contains the geometry symbolic name and the keyboard geometry
description. The geometry component might also contain aliases for some keys or
symbolic names for some indicators and might affect the set of indicators that
are physically present. Key aliases defined in the geometry component of a
keyboard mapping override those defined in the keycodes component.
