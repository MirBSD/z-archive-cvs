Xdm Sample Configuration

This directory contains a collection of files which describe a sample
configuration of xdm.  Choose between the sample Xservers.* files; copy the
appropriate one to "$(XDMDIR)/Xservers" along with the other
files in this directory.

Only a few of the many configuration parameters which xdm can be tuned with
are set in this sample, read the xdm manual page for a complete description.
