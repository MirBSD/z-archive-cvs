		  Instructions for building Editres.


Editres depends on the _EresInsert<something> and
_EresRetrieve<something> routines that are are implemented and used by
"EditresCom.c".  Since this module is intended to be included in your
widget library or toolkit, editres should automatically link in the
module, but if you have not included that module into your library you
will need to edit the makefile to make sure that editres links in this
file.
