 Video 4 Linux adaptor driver for XFree86 v4.0

 Developed by Gerd Knorr <kraxel@@goldbach.in-berlin.de> and
	David Woodhouse <David.Woodhouse@@mvhi.com>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This chipset driver does not provide a graphics adaptor driver, but instead
 registers a number of generic Xv adaptors which can be used with any graphics
 chipset driver.

 In order to use v4l adaptors with your favourite graphics driver, the
 graphics driver must do two things:

 1. Correctly set pScrn->memPhysBase and pScrn->fbOffset for the screens that
	it provides, to the physical address of the frame buffer memory, and
	the offset within that memory that the current mode starts,
	respectively.

 2. Use the xf86XVListGenericAdaptors() routine to list all available Xv
	adaptors which are usable with any target device, and initialise
	them on its screens with xf86XVScreenInit() as follows...

	    {
	       XF86VideoAdaptorPtr *ptr;

	       int xvexts = xf86XVListGenericAdaptors(&ptr);

	       if (xvexts) {
	           xf86XVScreenInit(pScreen, ptr, xvexts);
	       }
	    }
