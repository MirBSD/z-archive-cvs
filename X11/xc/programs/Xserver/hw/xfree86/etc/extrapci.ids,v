@#
#	Modifications and additions to the standard list of PCI IDs in
#	pci.ids.
#
#	To modify an entry, simply add the modified version here.
#	To leave part of an entry unchanged, use '"' for the name
#	(e.g., leave the vendor name unchanged while adding/modifying
#	a device).  To delete an entry, set the name to '-'.
#
#	One syntax extension is allowing a 16-bit class value to be
#	specified for a device (see the syntax description below).
#
#	Don't make gratuitous changes, and please send back
#	changes/additions that aren't XFree86-specific to the pciids
#	project (http://pciids.sf.net/).
