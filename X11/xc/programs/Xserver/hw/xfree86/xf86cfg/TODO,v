@$XFree86: xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/xf86cfg/TODO,v 1.1 2001/07/04 16:09:14 paulo Exp $

o Have code to fetch the SymTabRec chipset list from a video driver.
  This is mostly useful for the testing tool/interface, so that the
  Cards file "uptodate" state can also be verified.
	Probably it is better to forgot about the Cards file, and
	either parse the output of scanpci, or link libscanpci.a
	(and whatever else be required) in xf86cfg.

o Check if a module is "certified", there was some talk about a
  certification process in the past.

o Rewrite mouse driver to use the same code as video drivers, so that
  it is possible to store all available options in a single place.
  This would also require rewriting all existing input device modules.
  (Probably most of this can be made with cpp macros).

o Create a protocol to allow 3rd part xf86cfg modules.

o Write an interface for testing extensions/accel, maybe a frontend to
  xdpyinfo, x11perf, glxinfo, etc.

o Write a "wizard" mode, as several users find the graphical interface
  too complicated, but find the text one easier to user.

o Write code to use a Monitors database, either update the old Monitors
  file or use RedHat MonitorsDB.
	Chris Morgan is writting code to use MonitorsDB.
  If xf86cfg could be changed to ddcprobe (in all supported platforms),
  it would be even be a better solution than using a database.

o Add interface to allow changing comments without the need of editing
  XF86Config with a text editor.
