Build the drivers in the SDK
----------------------------

% ./mkmf
% make

Testing the built drivers
-------------------------
* edit the ./XF86Config file appropriately, as well as adding the line

      ModulePath  "$(DriverSDKDir)/modules"

  to the files section of the XF86Config file, where DriverSDKDir is usually
  /usr/X11R6/lib/Server. Then run the command

% xinit -- ./XFree86 -xf86config ./XF86config

Basic instructions to add driver "foo" to SDK
----------------------------------------------

* edit xf86site.def file adding a line like

	#define XF86ExtraCardDrivers foo

* create a directory drivers/foo, and copy the drivers/vga/Imakefile to it

* Replace instances of vga in Imakefile with "foo" and instances of "generic"
	with another suitable name

* Read the DESIGN document about how to write a driver, and use
	drivers/vga/generic.c as a basis to write the new driver.
