@Initial revision

text
@The following changes have been made to this directory since R3 (for
a full description, see doc/Server/r4.tbl.ms):

     o  Windows restructured (memory reduction, devPrivates and speedups)
     o  GCs restructured (memory reduction, devPrivates and wrappers)
     o  Screens restructured (window ops merged in, devPrivates)
     o  Pixmaps restructured (drawable changes mostly)
     o  Cursors restructured (shares glyph bits now)
     o  Visuals restructured (screen index removed, fields rearranged)
     o  Devices restructured (input extension changes)
     o  Out of memory changes.  Many interfaces now return OutOfMemory
     	status.
     o  Synchronous grab code rewritten.  Should conform to our
     	understanding of the protocol now.  Be careful when time
	stamping events (don't allow time to run backwards).
     o  Resource types redesigned and rewritten.
     o  Internal fake color allocation routine for software cursors.
