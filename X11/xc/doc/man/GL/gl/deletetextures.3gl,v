.SH NAME
.B "glDeleteTextures
\- delete named textures

.SH C SPECIFICATION
void \f3glDeleteTextures\fP(
GLsizei \fIn\fP,
.nf
.ta \w'\f3void \fPglDeleteTextures( 'u
	const GLuint \fI*textures\fP )
.fi

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fItextures\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2n\fP
Specifies the number of textures to be deleted.
.TP
\f2textures\fP
Specifies an array of textures to be deleted. 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glDeleteTextures\fP deletes \f2n\fP textures named by the elements of the array \f2textures\fP.
After a texture is deleted, it has no contents or dimensionality,
and its name is free for reuse (for example by \%\f3glGenTextures\fP).
If a texture that is currently bound is deleted, the binding reverts
to 0 (the default texture).
.P
\%\f3glDeleteTextures\fP silently ignores 0's and names that do not correspond to
existing textures.
.SH NOTES
\%\f3glDeleteTextures\fP is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_VALUE\fP is generated if \f2n\fP is negative.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glDeleteTextures\fP is executed
between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP and the corresponding
execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
