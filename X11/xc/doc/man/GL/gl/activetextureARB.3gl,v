\- select active texture unit

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2texture\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2texture\fP
Specifies which texture unit to make active. The number
of texture units is implementation dependent, but must be at least
two. \f2texture\fP must be one of \%\f3GL_TEXTURE\fP$i$\f3_ARB\fP, where 
0 \(<= $ i $ < \%\f3GL_MAX_TEXTURE_UNITS_ARB\fP, which is an
implementation-dependent value.  The initial value is \%\f3GL_TEXTURE0_ARB\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glActiveTextureARB\fP selects which texture unit subsequent texture state calls will
affect.  The number of texture units an implementation supports is
implementation dependent, but must be at least 2.
.P
Vertex arrays are client-side GL resources, which are selected by the 
\%\f3glClientActiveTextureARB\fP routine.
.SH NOTES
\%\f3glActiveTextureARB\fP is only supported if \%\f3GL_ARB_multitexture\fP is included in the
string returned by \%\f3glGetString\fP when called with the argument
\%\f3GL_EXTENSIONS\fP.
.SH ERRORS 
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2texture\fP is not one of
\%\f3GL_TEXTURE\fP$i$\f3_ARB\fP,
.br
where 0 \(<= $ i $ < \%\f3GL_MAX_TEXTURE_UNITS_ARB\fP.
