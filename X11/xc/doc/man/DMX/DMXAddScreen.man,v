.SH NAME
DMXAddScreen \- attach a new back-end screen
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <X11/extensions/dmxext.h>
.sp
.nf
.BI "Bool DMXAddScreen(Display " *dpy ,
.BI "                  const char " *displayName ,
.BI "                  unsigned int " mask ,
.BI "                  DMXScreenAttributes " *attr ,
.BI "                  int " *screen );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DMXAddScreen()
attaches a back-end screen to the
.BR Xdmx (1)
server, in place of the previously detached back-end server specified by
.IR screen .
.PP
.I displayName
is the name of the new back-end display,
.I mask
specifies the field in
.I attr
that are active, and
.I screen
returns the new
.BR Xdmx (1)
screen number for the attached screen.
.PP
The information stored in
.I mask " and " attr
is identical to that used by the
.BR DMXChangeScreenAttributes (3X)
and
.BR DMXGetScreenAttribues (3X)
functions.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B DMXAddScreen()
will return
.B True
if the screen was successfully attached, and
.B False
otherwise.
.B False
will be returned if the
.I \-addremovescreens
command line option was not specified on the
.BR Xdmx (1)
command line, the input value of
.I screen
is out of range,
.I screen
is not currently detached,
.I displayName
cannot be opened, has unexpected visuals, or has characteristics that do
not match the previously detached screen.
.PP
.B DMXAddScreen()
can generate
.BR BadLength ,
.BR BadAlloc ,
and
.B BadValue
errors.
.SH NOTES
Attributes that are not specified will default to 0.  This may lead to
unintended results.
.PP
Unlike other functions in the
.BR DMX (3X)
API, this function uses
.I screen
for both input and output.
