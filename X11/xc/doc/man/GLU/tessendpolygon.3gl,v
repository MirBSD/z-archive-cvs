\f2tess\fP
Specifies the tessellation object (created with \%\f3gluNewTess\fP).
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3gluTessBeginPolygon\fP and \%\f3gluTessEndPolygon\fP delimit the definition of a
convex, concave or self-intersecting polygon. Within each \%\f3gluTessBeginPolygon\fP/\%\f3gluTessEndPolygon\fP
pair, there must be one or more calls to \%\f3gluTessBeginContour\fP/\%\f3gluTessEndContour\fP. 
Within each contour, there are zero or more calls to \%\f3gluTessVertex\fP. The vertices 
specify a closed contour (the last vertex of each contour is automatically linked 
to the first). See the \%\f3gluTessVertex\fP, \%\f3gluTessBeginContour\fP and 
\%\f3gluTessEndContour\fP reference pages for more details.
.P
Once \%\f3gluTessEndPolygon\fP is called, the polygon is tessellated, and the
resulting triangles are described through callbacks.
See \%\f3gluTessCallback\fP for descriptions of the callback functions.
.SH EXAMPLE
A quadrilateral with a triangular hole in it can be described like this:
.sp
.Ex
gluTessBeginPolygon(tobj, NULL);
 gluTessBeginContour(tobj);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v1, v1);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v2, v2);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v3, v3);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v4, v4);
 gluTessEndContour(tobj);
 gluTessBeginContour(tobj);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v5, v5);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v6, v6);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v7, v7);
 gluTessEndContour(tobj);
gluTessEndPolygon(tobj);
.Ee
.bp
In the above example the pointers, $v1$ through $v7$, 
should point to different
addresses, 
since the values stored at these addresses will not be read by
the tesselator until \%\f3gluTessEndPolygon\fP is called.
