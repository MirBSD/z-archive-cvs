The x86emu library is under a BSD style license, comaptible
with the XFree86 and X licenses used by XFree86. The
original x86emu libraries were under the GNU General Public
License. Due to license incompatibilities between the GPL
and the XFree86 license, the original authors of the code
decided to allow a license change. If you have submitted
code to the original x86emu project, and you don't agree
with the license change, please contact us and let you
know. Your code will be removed to comply with your wishes.

If you have any questions about this, please send email to
x86emu@@linuxlabs.com or KendallB@@scitechsoft.com for
clarification.
