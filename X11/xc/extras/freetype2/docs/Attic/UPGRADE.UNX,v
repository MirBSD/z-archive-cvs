SPECIAL NOTE FOR UNIX USERS
===========================

  If  you are  installing  this release  of  FreeType on  a system  that
  already uses  release 2.0.5  (or even an  older version), you  have to
  perform a few special steps to ensure that everything goes well.


  1. Enable the TrueType bytecode hinter if you need it
  -----------------------------------------------------

    See the instructions in the file `TRUETYPE' of this directory.
   
    Note  that FreeType  supports  TrueType fonts  without the  bytecode
    interpreter through its  auto-hinter, which now generates relatively
    good results with most fonts.


  2. Determine the correct installation path
  ------------------------------------------

    By   default,  the   configure  script   installs  the   library  in
    `/usr/local'.   However,  many Unix  distributions  now install  the
    library  in `/usr',  since FreeType  is becoming  a  critical system
    component.

    If FreeType is already installed on your system, type

      freetype-config --prefix

    on  the command  line.   This should  return  the installation  path
    (e.g.,  `/usr'  or `/usr/local').   To  avoid  problems of  parallel
    FreeType  versions, use  this path  for the  --prefix option  of the
    configure script.

    Otherwise, simply use `/usr' (or  whatever you think is adequate for
    your installation).


  3. Ensure that you are using GNU Make
  -------------------------------------

    The FreeType build  system _exclusively_ works with GNU  Make (as an
    exception you  can use make++ which emulates  GNU Make sufficiently;
    see http://makepp.sourceforge.net).  You will not be able to compile
    the library with the  instructions below using any other alternative
    (including BSD Make).

    Trying to  compile the library with  a different Make  tool prints a
    message like:

      Sorry, GNU make is required to build FreeType2.

    and the build process is aborted.  If this happens, install GNU Make
    on your system, and use the GNUMAKE environment variable to name it.


  4. Build and install the library
  --------------------------------

    The  following should  work on  all  Unix systems  where the  `make'
    command invokes GNU Make:

      ./configure --prefix=<yourprefix>
      make
      make install           (as root)

    where `<yourprefix>' must be replaced  by the prefix returned by the
    `freetype-config' command.

    When using a  different command to invoke GNU  Make, use the GNUMAKE
    variable.  For  example, if  `gmake' is the  command to use  on your
    system, do something like:

      GNUMAKE=gmake ./configure --prefix=<yourprefix>
      gmake
      gmake install            (as root)


  5. Take care of XFree86 version 4
  ---------------------------------

    Certain Linux  distributions install _several_  versions of FreeType
    on your  system.  For example, on  a fresh Mandrake  8.1 system, you
    can find the following files:

      /usr/lib/libfreetype.so             which links to
      /usr/lib/libfreetype.6.1.0.so

    and

      /usr/X11R6/lib/libfreetype.so       which links to
      /usr/X11R6/lib/libfreetype.6.0.so

    Note that  these files  correspond to two  distinct versions  of the
    library!  It seems that this  surprising issue is due to the install
    scripts of  recent XFree86 servers (from 4.1.0)  which install their
    own (dated) version of the library in `/usr/X11R6/lib'.

    In certain  _rare_ cases  you may experience  minor problems  if you
    install this  release of  the library in  `/usr' only,  namely, that
    certain applications do not benefit from the bug fixes and rendering
    improvements you would expect.

    There are two good ways to deal with this situation:

      - Install the library _twice_,  in `/usr' and in `/usr/X11R6' (you
        have to  do that  each time you  install a new  FreeType release
        though).

      - Change the link in /usr/X11R6/lib/libfreetype.so to point to

          /usr/lib/libfreetype.so,

        and get rid of

          /usr/X11R6/lib/libfreetype.6.0.so

    The FreeType  Team is  not responsible for  this problem,  so please
    contact  either   the  XFree86   development  team  or   your  Linux
    distributor to help  clear this issue in case  the information given
    here doesn't help.
