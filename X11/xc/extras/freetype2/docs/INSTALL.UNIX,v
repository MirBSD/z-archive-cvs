@This  document contains  instructions  on how  to  build the  FreeType
library on Unix  systems.  This also works for  emulations like Cygwin
or MSys on Win32:


  1. Ensure that you are using GNU Make
  -------------------------------------

    The FreeType build system  _exclusively_ works with GNU Make.  You
    will  not be  able to  compile the  library with  the instructions
    below using any other alternative (including BSD Make).

    Check that you have GNU make by running the command:

       make -v

    This should dump some text that begins with:

       GNU Make  <version number>
       Copyright (C) <year> Free Software Foundation Inc.

    Note that version  3.80 or higher is *required* or the  build will
    fail.

    It is also fine to have GNU Make under another name (e.g. 'gmake')
    if you use the MAKE variable as described below.

    As  a  special exception,  'makepp'  can  also  be used  to  build
    FreeType 2.  See the file docs/MAKEPP for details.


  2. Regenerate the configure script if needed
  --------------------------------------------

    This only applies if you  are building a git snapshot or checkout,
    *not* if you grabbed the sources of an official release.

    You  need  to invoke  the  `autogen.sh'  script  in the  top-level
    directory  in order  to  create the  `configure'  script for  your
    platform.  Normally, this simply means typing:

      sh autogen.sh

    In case of problems, you  may need to install or upgrade Automake,
    Autoconf or  Libtool.  See  README.git in the  top-level directory
    for more information.


  3. Build and install the library
  --------------------------------

    The following  should work  on all Unix  systems where  the `make'
    command invokes GNU Make:

      ./configure [options]
      make
      make install           (as root)

    The default installation path  is `/usr/local'.  It can be changed
    with the `--prefix=<path>' option.  Example:

      ./configure --prefix=/usr

    When using  a different command  to invoke GNU Make,  use the MAKE
    variable.  For example,  if `gmake' is the command  to use on your
    system, do something like:

       MAKE=gmake ./configure [options]
       gmake
       gmake install            (as root)

    If  this still doesn't  work, there  must be  a problem  with your
    system (e.g., you are using a very old version of GNU Make).

    It  is possible  to  compile FreeType  in  a different  directory.
    Assuming the FreeType source  files in directory `/src/freetype' a
    compilation in directory `foo' works as follows:

      cd foo
      /src/freetype/configure [options]
      make
      make install


  3.1 Interdependency with HarfBuzz
  .................................

    Note that there  is a chicken-and-egg problem  currently since the
    HarfBuzz library  (used by the  auto-hinter to improve  support of
    OpenType  fonts)  depends on  FreeType,  which  can be  solved  as
    follows in case HarfBuzz is not yet installed on your system.

    1. Call    FreeType's     `configure'    script     with    option
       `--without-harfbuzz', then compile and install FreeType.

    2. Compile and install HarfBuzz.

    3. Call    FreeType's    `configure'   script    without    option
       `--without-harfbuzz' (after  executing `make  distclean'), then
       compile and install FreeType again.
