@Here is a list of items that need to be addressed in FreeType 2
---------------------------------------------------------------

* Implement stem3/counter hints properly in the Postscript hinter.

* Add CIDCMap support to the CID driver.

* Add track kerning support to the PFR driver.

* Add kerning (AFM file) support to the CID driver.


Here is a list of bugs which should be handled
----------------------------------------------

Other bugs have been registered at the savannah bugzilla of FreeType.

* CID driver:
    Handle the case where a CID font has a top-level font matrix also
    (see PLRM, 5.11.3, Type 0 CIDFonts).  Since CID_FaceInfoRec lacks
    a font_matrix entry we have to directly apply it to all subfont
    matrices.

* CID driver:
    Use top-level font matrix entry for setting the upem value, not the
    entries in the FDarray.  If absent, use 1000.

* Finalize the cache sub-system.  It has been in beta far too long :-)

* The automatic and Postscript hinters have been improved to increase
  the quality of AA text, but Monochrome and LCD hinting still suck.  We
  need to do something about that.

Here is a list of items that need to be addressed in FreeType 2; they are
not exactly bugs, but should be considered though:
d14 1
a14 3
* Add track kerning support to the Type1 and PFR driver and the API
  (The degree of kerning, e.g. light, normal or tight, and
  the glyph size has to be passed as parameter).
d18 26
a43 1
* Possibly add support for reading PFM files.
