@This  file  contains a  list  of various  font  formats.   It gives  the
reference document and whether it is supported in FreeType 2.


  file type:
    The only special  case is `MAC'; on older Mac  OS versions, a `file'
    is  stored as  a  data and  a  resource fork,  this  is, within  two
    separate data chunks.   In all other cases, the  font data is stored
    in a single file.

  wrapper format:
    The format used  to represent the font data.  In  the table below it
    is used only if the font format differs.  Possible values are `SFNT'
    (binary), `PS' (a text header, followed by binary or text data), and
    `LZW' (compressed with either `gzip' or `compress').

  font format:
    How the font  is to be accessed, possibly  after converting the file
    type and  wrapper format  into a generic  form.  Bitmap  formats are
    `BDF',  `PCF', and  one  form  of `WINFNT';  all  others are  vector
    formats.

  font type:
    Sub-formats  of the font  format.  `SBIT'  and `MACSBIT'  are bitmap
    formats, `MM' and `VAR' support optical axes.

  glyph access:
    If not specified, the glyph access is `standard' to the font format.
    Values are  `CID' for CID-keyed  fonts, `SYNTHETIC' for  fonts which
    are modified  versions of other  fonts by means of  a transformation
    matrix, `COLLECTION' for collecting  multiple fonts (sharing most of
    the data) into a single file, and `TYPE_0' for PS fonts which are to
    be accessed in a tree-like structure.

  FreeType driver:
    The module in  the FreeType library which handles  the specific font
    format.   A missing entry  means that  FreeType doesn't  support the
    font format (yet).


Please  send  additions  and/or  corrections  to wl@@gnu.org  or  to  the
FreeType developer's list  at freetype-devel@@nongnu.org (for subscribers
only).   If you  can provide  a font  example for  a format  which isn't
supported yet please send a mail too.

    in a PS wrapper.

[3] Support is rudimentary currently; some tables are not loaded yet.

[4] There is no formal PCF specification; you have to deduce the exact
    format from the source code within X11.  George Williams did this for
    his FontForge editor:

This  file contains  a list  of various  font formats.   It gives  the
a3 2
Table fields
------------
d5 33
a37 29
  wrapper format
    The format used to represent the font data.  In the table below it
    is  used only  if the  font format  differs.  Possible  values are
    `SFNT' (binary), `PS'  (a text header, followed by  binary or text
    data), `LZW'  (compressed with  either `gzip' or  `compress'), and
    `BZ2' (compressed with `bzip2`).

  font format
    How the font is to be accessed, possibly after converting the file
    type and wrapper  format into a generic form.   Bitmap formats are
    `BDF',  `PCF', and  one form  of `WINFNT';  all others  are vector
    formats.   `PS' indicates  third-order,  `TT' second-order  Bézier
    curves.

  font type
    Sub-formats of the  font format.  `SBIT' and  `MACSBIT' are bitmap
    formats,  `MM' and  `VAR' support  optical axes.   `CFF2' supports
    optical axes also.

  glyph access
    If  not specified,  the glyph  access  is `standard'  to the  font
    format.   Values are  `CID' for  CID-keyed fonts,  `SYNTHETIC' for
    fonts that  are modified  versions of  other fonts  by means  of a
    transformation matrix, and  `TYPE_0' for PS fonts which  are to be
    accessed in a tree-like structure.

  FreeType driver
    The module in the FreeType library which handles the specific font
    format.  A missing  entry means that FreeType  doesn't support the
d41 80
a120 2
Notes
-----
a121 101
  The  SFNT  container  format also  provides  `collections'  (usually
  having the file extension `.ttc'  or `.otc').  A collection contains
  multiple font faces that share some tables to avoid redundancy, thus
  reducing the file  size.  In FreeType, elements of  a collection can
  be accessed with a proper face index.

  Both  the GX  and the  OpenType 1.8  variation fonts  provide `named
  instances'.  FreeType  maps them to  face indices (they can  also be
  accessed with the standard MM interface).

  Other  font  formats  (not  using the  SFNT  wrapper)  also  provide
  multiple faces  within one  file; they are  marked with  an asterisk
  (`*') in the table below.

  FreeType can  be configured to  support Mac  files (on older  Mac OS
  versions, a `file' is stored as a data and a resource fork, this is,
  within two  separate data chunks).  If  a file can't be  opened as a
  font, FreeType then checks whether it  is a resource fork, trying to
  extract  the contained  font data  from  either a  `POST' or  `sfnt'
  resource.


Please  send additions  and/or  corrections to  wl@@gnu.org  or to  the
FreeType   developer's   list    at   freetype-devel@@nongnu.org   (for
subscribers only).   If you can  provide a  font example for  a format
which isn't supported yet please send a mail too.

    for a specification given in Appendix D on pgs. 436-450.  However,

    George Williams deduced  the font format from the  X11 sources and
    documented it for his FontForge font editor:
