@  FreeType 2.7.1
  ==============

  Homepage: http://www.freetype.org

  FreeType is a freely available software library to render fonts.

  It  is  written  in  C,  designed to  be  small,  efficient,  highly
  customizable, and  portable while capable of  producing high-quality
  output  (glyph  images) of  most  vector  and bitmap  font  formats.

  Please   read   the  docs/CHANGES   file,   it  contains   IMPORTANT
  INFORMATION.

  Read the  files `docs/INSTALL*'  for installation  instructions; see
  the file `docs/LICENSE.TXT' for the available licenses.

  The FreeType 2 API reference is located in `docs/reference'; use the
  file   `ft2-toc.html'   as   the   top  entry   point.    Additional
  documentation is available as a separate package from our sites.  Go
  to

    http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/

  and download one of the following files.

    freetype-doc-2.7.1.tar.bz2
    freetype-doc-2.7.1.tar.gz
    ftdoc271.zip

  To view the documentation online, go to

    http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/documentation.html


  Mailing Lists
  =============

  The preferred way  of communication with the FreeType  team is using
  e-mail lists.

    general use and discussion:      freetype@@nongnu.org
    engine internals, porting, etc.: freetype-devel@@nongnu.org
    announcements:                   freetype-announce@@nongnu.org
    git repository tracker:          freetype-commit@@nongnu.org

  The lists are moderated; see

  how to subscribe.


  Bugs
  ====

  Please submit bug reports at

    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=freetype

  Alternatively,    you   might    report    bugs    by   e-mail    to
  `freetype-devel@@nongnu.org'.   Don't  forget   to  send  a  detailed
  explanation of the problem --  there is nothing worse than receiving
  a terse message that only says `it doesn't work'.


  Enjoy!
