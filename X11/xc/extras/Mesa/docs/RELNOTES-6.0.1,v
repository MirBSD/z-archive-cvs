		       Mesa 6.0.1 release notes

			    April 2, 2003



Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Even-numbered versions (such as 6.0.x) designate stable releases.
Odd-numbered versions (such as 6.1.x) designate new developmental releases.

Mesa 6.0.1 just fixes bugs found since the 6.0 release.  See the VERSIONS
file for details.



Device Drivers
--------------

Mesa advertises itself as supporting OpenGL 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 or 1.5
depending on the device driver's capabilities.  For example, if the
driver enables all the ARB extensions which are part of OpenGL 1.5
then glGetString(GL_VERSION) will return "1.5".  Otherwise, it'll
return "1.4" or the next lower version that implements all required
functionality.

A number of Mesa's software drivers haven't been actively maintained for
some time.  We rely on volunteers to maintain many of the drivers.
Here's the current status of all included drivers:

Driver			Status
----------------------	---------------------
XMesa (Xlib)		implements OpenGL 1.5
OSMesa (off-screen)	implements OpenGL 1.5
FX (3dfx Voodoo1/2)	implements OpenGL 1.3
SVGA			implements OpenGL 1.3
Wind River UGL		implements OpenGL 1.3
Windows/Win32		implements OpenGL 1.5
DJGPP			implements OpenGL 1.5
GGI			implements OpenGL 1.3
BeOS			implements OpenGL 1.5
Allegro			needs updating
D3D			needs updating
