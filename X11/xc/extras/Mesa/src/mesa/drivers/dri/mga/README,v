@MGA DRI driver ported from XF86DRI to FBDRI
by Denis Oliver Kropp <dok@@directfb.org>


INFO

This driver has been ported from the head branch of XFree86 to
the embedded-1-branch of Mesa.


STATUS

Already working very well as far as I've tested it (16/32 bit).
glxgears runs at 935 fps (G550 32MB AGP 4x, Athlon 1.33) vs 744 fps with XFree.
Other demos (terrain, fire, etc.) have been successfully tested as well.


TODO

- mgaEngineShutdown
- mgaEngineRestore
- SGRAM detection
- remove some unused bits from server/*
- subset driver support
- mgaWaitForVBlank
- deinitialization (from MGADRICloseScreen) a la radeonDestroyScreen
