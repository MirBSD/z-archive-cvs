 * This routine forces a reference to vendor shell so that the one in this
 * widget is installed.  Any other cross-widget set initialization should be
 * done here as well.  All Athena widgets should include "XawInit.h" and
 * call this routine from their ClassInitialize procs (this routine may be
 * used as the class init proc).
