evilwm 1.0 by Ciaran Anscomb <evilwm@@6809.org.uk>

evilwm is a minimalist window manager for the X Window System.

The name evil came from Stuart 'Stuii' Ford, who thinks that any software
I use must be evil and masochistic.  In reality, this window manager is
clean and easy to use.


FEATURES

 * No window decorations apart from a simple 1 pixel border.
 * No icons.
 * Good keyboard control, including repositioning and maximise toggles.
 * Solid window drags (compile time option - may be slow on old machines).
 * Virtual desktops.
 * Small binary size (even with everything turned on).


INSTALLATION

Please see the file INSTALL for details on building evilwm
outside MirOS X11, and just use the MirOS Makefile for building
it in-tree.


STARTING EVILWM

If you use a session manager from GNOME or KDE or something like that,
you'll have to read its documentation to see how to set which window
manager it uses.

However if you're just using a standard X desktop, you can start evilwm
by just changing your ~/.xinitrc file.  Here's a pretty standard sample
file:

-----CUT HERE-----
[ -f $HOME/.Xdefaults ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xdefaults
xsetroot -solid \#400040 -cursor_name top_left_arrow
/usr/bin/evilwm &
exec xclock -digital -padding 2 -g -0+0
-----CUT HERE-----

Note that in this case 'xclock' is the magic process (the one that if
you kill it, your session dies).  You could change it around and have
evilwm be your magic process if you prefer.  Also note that it sets the
cursor shape and background colour with standard X tools (evilwm won't
do this for you - the tools already exist!).


CONTROLS

You can use the mouse to manipulate windows either by click/dragging
the 1 pixel border, or by holding down Alt and doing so anywhere in the
client window.  The controls are:

Button 1	Move window
Button 2	Resize window
Button 3	Lower window

Most keyboard controls are used by holding down Control and Alt, then
pressing a key.  Available functions are:

Return		Spawn new xterm
Escape		Delete current window
Insert		Lower current window
H, J, K, L	Move window left, down, up or right (16 pixels)
Y, U, B, N	Move window to top-left, top-right, bottom-left or
		bottom-right of screen
Q, W, E, R	Resize window (-X, +Y, -Y, +X) by a pixel or the
		increasement unit given by the program
		ATTENTION: No overflow checking is done!
I		Show information about current window
Equals		Maximise current window vertically (toggle)
X		Maximise current window (toggle)
accent gravis	Exit evilwm forcefully but nicely

If compiled with virtual desktop support, these functions are also
available:

F		Fix or unfix window (toggle its 'sticky' status)
1 - 8		Switch virtual desktop
Left		Previous virtual desktop
Right		Next virtual desktop

In addition to the above, Alt+Tab can be used to cycle through windows
on screen.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The original code base for this project was that of aewm by Decklin
Foster.  His code is very clean and, in later versions, very well
commented.  I'd recommend it if you want to learn more about window
manager theory (or indeed want title bars, etc ;).
