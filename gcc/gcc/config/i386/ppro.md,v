@Don't emit the 'cld' insn any more because both i386 and amd64 ABI
require the direction flag to be clear at function entry and exit,
and we never emit the 'std' insn either. Assembly code (inline and
linked in) must take care of adhering to the ABI by itself (but it
is the same scenario like using SSE registers and not cleaning up)
and I grepped in our source and didn't find problematic places.

Idea and (relative to gcc 4.3) patch by Uros Bizjak; not tested in
MirOS/gcc 3.4.6+ yet, but ought to be safe.
