/* Node: Condition Code */

/* Like other non-CC0 ports, MMIX need to code which combination of
   comparison insn and branch insn or conditional-set insn to use into the
   condition mode.  The CC mode depends partly on which condition is used
   and partly on the type of the operands.  */

/* The "usual" CC mode is used for a signed operands integer comparison,
   where the CMP insn is used and the result is (integer) -1, 0 or 1 for
   respectively a < b, a == b and a > b.  */

/* The CC_UNS mode is for an unsigned operands integer comparison using
   the CMPU insn.  Result values correspond to those in CCmode.  */
CC_MODE (CC_UNS);

/* The CC_FP mode is for a non-equality floating-point comparison, using
   the FCMP or FCMPE insn.  The result is (integer) -1 or 1 for
   espectively a < b and a > b, otherwise 0.  */
CC_MODE (CC_FP);

/* The CC_FPEQ mode is for an equality floating-point comparison, using
   the FEQL or FEQLE insn.  The result is (integer) 1 for a == b,
   otherwise 0 (including NaN:s).  */
CC_MODE (CC_FPEQ);

/* The CC_FUN mode is for an ordering comparison, using the FUN or FUNE
   insn.  The result is (integer) 1 if a is unordered to b, otherwise the
   result is 0.  */
