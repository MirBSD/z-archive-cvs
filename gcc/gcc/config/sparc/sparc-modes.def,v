/* Add any extra modes needed to represent the condition code.

   On the SPARC, we have a "no-overflow" mode which is used when an add or
   subtract insn is used to set the condition code.  Different branches are
   used in this case for some operations.

   We also have two modes to indicate that the relevant condition code is
   in the floating-point condition code register.  One for comparisons which
   will generate an exception if the result is unordered (CCFPEmode) and
   one for comparisons which will never trap (CCFPmode).

   CCXmode and CCX_NOOVmode are only used by v9.  */
