  above). SpoolerOutput, if not Null, will be redirected from the
  printer spooler's standard output and error. If you use this, note
  that a deadlock might arise when trying to write data to the
  spooler while its output is not being read, though this seems
  quite unlikely, since most printer spoolers don't write so much
  output that could fill a pipe. Under Dos, where no spooler is
  involved, SpoolerOutput, if not Null, will be reset to an empty
  file for compatibility. }
