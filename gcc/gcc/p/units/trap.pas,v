@{ Trapping runtime errors

  The Trap unit allows you to trap runtime errors, so a runtime
  error will not abort the program, but pass the control back to a
  point within the program.

  The usage is simple. The TrapExec procedure can be called with a
  function (p) as an argument. p must take a Boolean argument. p
  will immediately be called with False given as its argument. When
  a runtime error would otherwise be caused while p is active, p
  will instead be called again with True as its argument. After p
  returns, runtime error trapping ends.

  When the program terminates (e.g. by reaching its end or by a Halt
  statement) and a runtime error was trapped during the run, Trap
  will set the ExitCode and ErrorAddr variables to indicate the
  trapped error.

  Notes:

  - After trapping a runtime error, your program might not be in a
    stable state. If the runtime error was a "minor" one (such as a
    range checking or arithmetic error), it should not be a problem.
    But if you, e.g., write a larger application and use Trap to
    prevent a sudden abort caused by an unexpected runtime error,
    you should make the program terminate regularly as soon as
    possible after a trapped error (perhaps by telling the user to
    save the data, then terminate the program and report the bug to
    you).

  - Since the trapping mechanism *jumps* back, it has all the
    negative effects that a (non-local!) `goto' can have! You should
    be aware of the consequences of all active procedures being
    terminated at an arbitrary point!

  - Nested traps are supported, i.e. you can call TrapExec again
    within a routine called by another TrapExec instance. Runtime
    errors trapped within the inner TrapExec invocation will be
    trapped by the inner TrapExec, while runtime errors trapped
    after its termination will be trapped by the outer TrapExec
    again.

implementation

{ @@@@ Implementation in pure Pascal without need of trapc.c. Fails under
     Solaris with gcc-2.95.x (backend bug); 2.8.1 and 3.x seem to be OK.
     The old code can probably removed after the transition to 3.x.
     Nonlocal `goto's still fail with gcc-3.x on Linux/S390 and
     Mac OS X. :-( `--longjmp-all-nonlocal-labels' helps. }
