package Lib.Util is

   --  This package implements a buffered write of library information

   procedure Write_Info_Char (C : Character);
   pragma Inline (Write_Info_Char);
   --  Adds one character to the info

   procedure Write_Info_Char_Code (Code : Char_Code);
   --  Write a single character code. Upper half values in the range
   --  16#80..16#FF are written as Uhh (hh = 2 hex digits), and values
   --  greater than 16#FF are written as Whhhh (hhhh = 4 hex digits).

   function Write_Info_Col return Positive;
   --  Returns the column in which the next character will be written

   procedure Write_Info_EOL;
   --  Terminate current info line. This only flushes the buffer
   --  if there is not enough room for another complete line or
   --  if the host system needs a write for each line.

   procedure Write_Info_Initiate (Key : Character);
   --  Initiates write of new line to info file, the parameter is the
   --  keyword character for the line. The caller is responsible for
   --  writing the required blank after the key character.

   procedure Write_Info_Nat (N : Nat);
   --  Adds image of N to Info_Buffer with no leading or trailing blanks

   procedure Write_Info_Name (Name : Name_Id);
   --  Adds characters of Name to Info_Buffer

   procedure Write_Info_Str (Val : String);
   --  Adds characters of Val to Info_Buffer surrounded by quotes

   procedure Write_Info_Tab (Col : Positive);
   --  Tab out with blanks and HT's to column Col. If already at or past
   --  Col, writes a single blank, so that we do get a required field
   --  separation.

   procedure Write_Info_Terminate;
   --  Terminate current info line and output lines built in Info_Buffer
