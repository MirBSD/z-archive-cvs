--  association between source file names and unit names as defined
--  (see package Uname for definition of format of unit names).

package Fname is

   --  Note: this package spec does not depend on the Uname spec in the Ada
   --  sense, but the comments and description of the semantics do depend on
   --  the conventions established by Uname.

   ---------------------------
   -- File Name Conventions --
   ---------------------------

   --  GNAT requires that there be a one to one correspondence between source
   --  file names (as used in the Osint package interface) and unit names as
   --  defined by the Uname package. This correspondence is defined by the
   --  two subprograms defined here in the Fname package.

   --   For full rules of file naming, see GNAT User's Guide. Note that the
   --   naming rules are affected by the presence of Source_File_Name pragmas
   --   that have been previously processed.

   --  Note that the file name does *not* include the directory name. The
   --  management of directories is provided by Osint, and full file names
   --  are used only for error message purposes within GNAT itself.

   --  file name with no directory information) is the file name for one of

   --  only children of Ada, Interfaces and System return True.
