--  The following private package allows the ouput of text to Makefiles

--  without putting them effectively in the Makefile.

private package Bld.IO is

   procedure Create (File_Name : String);
   --  Create a new Makefile

   procedure Flush;
   --  Output all not suppressed lines to the Makefile

   procedure Close;
   --  Close the current Makefile

   procedure Delete_All;
   --  Delete all the Makefiles that have been created

   function Name_Of_File return String;
   --  Return the path name of the current Makefile

   type Position is private;
   --  Identification of a line in the Makefile

   procedure Mark (Pos : out Position);
   --  Record the current line.
   --  No characters should have been already put on this line.

   procedure Release (Pos : Position);
   --  Suppress all line after this one, including this one.

   procedure Suppress (Pos : Position);
   --  Suppress a particular line

   procedure Put (S : String);
   --  Append a string to the current line

   procedure New_Line;
   --  End a line. Go to the next one (initially empty).
