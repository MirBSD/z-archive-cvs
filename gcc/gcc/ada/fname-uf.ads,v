--  This child package contains the routines to translate a unit name to
--  a file name taking into account Source_File_Name pragmas. It also
--  contains the auxiliary routines used to record data from the pragmas.

--  Note: the reason we split this into a child unit is that the routines
--  for unit name translation have a significant number of additional
--  dependencies, including osint, and hence sdefault. There are a number
--  of tools that use utility subprograms in the Fname parent, but do not
--  need the functionality in this child package (and certainly do not want
--  to deal with the extra dependencies).

   --  name, Uname. The Subunit parameter is set True for subunits, and
   --  false for all other kinds of units. The caller is responsible for
   --  ensuring that the unit name meets the requirements given in package
   --  Uname and described above.

   procedure Initialize;
   --  Initialize internal tables. This is called automatically when the
   --  package body is elaborated, so an explicit call to Initialize is
   --  only required if it is necessary to reinitialize the source file
   --  name pragma tables.

   procedure Lock;
   --  Lock tables before calling back end

   function File_Name_Of_Spec (Name : Name_Id) return File_Name_Type;
   --  Returns the file name that corresponds to the spec of a given unit
   --  name. The unit name here is not encoded as a Unit_Name_Type, but is
   --  rather just a normal form name in lower case, e.g. "xyz.def".

   function File_Name_Of_Body (Name : Name_Id) return File_Name_Type;
   --  Returns the file name that corresponds to the body of a given unit
   --  name. The unit name here is not encoded as a Unit_Name_Type, but is

   --  Make association between given unit name, U, and the given file name,
   --  F. This is the routine called to process a Source_File_Name pragma.

   --  argument is a file name pattern string.  Pat is this pattern string,
   --  which contains an asterisk to correspond to the unit. Typ is one of
   --  'b'/'s'/'u' for body/spec/subunit, Dot is the separator string
   --  for child/subunit names, and Cas is one of Lower/Upper/Mixed
   --  indicating the required case for the file name.
