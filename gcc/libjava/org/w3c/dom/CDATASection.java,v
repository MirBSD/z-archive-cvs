/**
 * CDATA sections are used to escape blocks of text containing characters that 
 * would otherwise be regarded as markup. The only delimiter that is 
 * recognized in a CDATA section is the "]]&gt;" string that ends the CDATA 
 * section. CDATA sections cannot be nested. Their primary purpose is for 
 * including material such as XML fragments, without needing to escape all 
 * the delimiters.
 * <p>The <code>DOMString</code> attribute of the <code>Text</code> node holds 
 * the text that is contained by the CDATA section. Note that this may 
 * contain characters that need to be escaped outside of CDATA sections and 
 * that, depending on the character encoding ("charset") chosen for 
 * serialization, it may be impossible to write out some characters as part 
 * of a CDATA section. 
 * <p> The <code>CDATASection</code> interface inherits from the 
 * <code>CharacterData</code> interface through the <code>Text</code> 
 * interface. Adjacent <code>CDATASection</code> nodes are not merged by use 
 * of the <code>normalize</code> method of the <code>Node</code> interface.
 * Because no markup is recognized within a <code>CDATASection</code>, 
 * character numeric references cannot be used as an escape mechanism when 
 * serializing. Therefore, action needs to be taken when serializing a 
 * <code>CDATASection</code> with a character encoding where some of the 
 * contained characters cannot be represented. Failure to do so would not 
 * produce well-formed XML.One potential solution in the serialization 
 * process is to end the CDATA section before the character, output the 
 * character using a character reference or entity reference, and open a new 
 * CDATA section for any further characters in the text node. Note, however, 
 * that some code conversion libraries at the time of writing do not return 
 * an error or exception when a character is missing from the encoding, 
 * making the task of ensuring that data is not corrupted on serialization 
 * more difficult.
 * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Core-20001113'>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Core Specification</a>.
