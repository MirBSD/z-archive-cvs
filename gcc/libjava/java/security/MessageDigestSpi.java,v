/**
   This is the Service Provider Interface (SPI) for MessageDigest
   class in java.security. It provides the back end functionality
   for the MessageDigest class so that it can compute message 
   hashes. The default hashes are SHA-1 and MD5. A message hash
   takes data of arbitrary length and produces a unique number
   representing it. 

   Cryptography service providers who want to implement their
   own message digest hashes need only to subclass this class.

   The implementation of a Cloneable interface is left to up to 
   the programmer of a subclass.
