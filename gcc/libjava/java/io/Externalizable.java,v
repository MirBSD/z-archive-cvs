/**
 * This interface provides a way that classes can completely control how
 * the data of their object instances  are written and read to and from 
 * streams.  It has two methods which are used to write the data to a stream 
 * and to read the data from a stream.  The read method must read the data 
 * in exactly the way it was written by the write method. 
 * <p>
 * Note that classes which implement this interface must take into account
 * that all superclass data must also be written to the stream as well.  
 * The class implementing this interface must figure out how to make that
 * happen.
 * <p>
 * This interface can be used to provide object persistence.  When an 
 * object is to be stored externally, the <code>writeExternal</code> method is
 * called to save state.  When the object is restored, an instance is
 * created using the default no-argument constructor and the 
 * <code>readExternal</code> method is used to restore the state.
