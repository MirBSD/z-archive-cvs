/**
 * Interface for objects that can be ordering among other objects. The
 * ordering can be <em>total</em>, such that two objects only compare equal
 * if they are also equal by the equals method, or <em>partial</em> such
 * that this is not necessarily true. For example, a case-sensitive
 * dictionary order comparison of Strings is total, but if it is
 * case-insensitive it is partial, because "abc" and "ABC" compare as
 * equal even though "abc".equals("ABC") returns false. However, if you use
 * a partial ordering, it is a good idea to document your class as
 * "inconsistent with equals", because the behavior of your class in a
 * SortedMap will be different than in a HashMap.
 *
 * <p>Lists, arrays, and sets of objects that implement this interface can
 * be sorted automatically, without the need for an explicit
 * {@@link Comparator}. Note that <code>e1.compareTo(null)</code> should
 * throw an Exception; as should comparison between incompatible classes.
