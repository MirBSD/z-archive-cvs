@$MirOS: gcc/libjava/LIBGCJ_LICENSE,v 1.2 2005/03/26 10:19:00 tg Exp $

Linking with independent modules may be not covered by the GNU GPL,
but inheriting a class from libgcj seems to be. The key term seems
to be "independent module"; the FSF does not want to clarify if a
class which is derived from a libgcj class (such as Applet) may be
considered no derived work from libgcj, or in which cases. We thusly
urge people to not use gcj with libgcj for developing their programmes.

combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you

executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from
or based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend
this exception to your version of the library, but you are not

but inheriting a class from libgcj seems to be. That's why we add
the _gplwarn.c file and urge people to not use gcj with libgcj for
