@# GCC_NO_EXECUTABLES
# -----------------
# FIXME: The GCC team has specific needs which the current Autoconf
# framework cannot solve elegantly.  This macro implements a dirty
# hack until Autoconf is able to provide the services its users
# need.
#
# Several of the support libraries that are often built with GCC can't
# assume the tool-chain is already capable of linking a program: the
# compiler often expects to be able to link with some of such
# libraries.
#
# In several of these libraries, workarounds have been introduced to
# avoid the AC_PROG_CC_WORKS test, that would just abort their
# configuration.  The introduction of AC_EXEEXT, enabled either by
# libtool or by CVS autoconf, have just made matters worse.
#
# Unlike the previous AC_NO_EXECUTABLES, this test does not
# disable link tests at autoconf time, but at configure time.
# This allows AC_NO_EXECUTABLES to be invoked conditionally.
