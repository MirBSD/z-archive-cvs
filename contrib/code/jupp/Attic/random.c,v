/*
 * This is derived from the Berkeley source:
 *	@@(#)random.c	5.5 (Berkeley) 7/6/88
 * It was reworked for the GNU C Library by Roland McGrath.
 *
 * Fixed to be portable to MSDOS by jhallen (changed ints to longs)
 *
 * jhallen- Made sure functions work if long is larger than 32 bits- it does
 *          Long is required to be at least 32 bits
 *          Also made saving and restoring state information far simpler
