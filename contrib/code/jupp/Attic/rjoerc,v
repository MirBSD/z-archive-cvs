                         Initialization file for JOE
                            Restricted access Joe

 JOE looks for this file in:
	1 - .joerc
	2 - $HOME/.joerc
	3 - /usr/local/lib/joerc

 This file can include other files by placing the following include command
 in the first column:

 :include filename

 FIRST SECTION: Default global options (these options can also be specified
 on the command line.  Also the NOXON, LINES, COLUMNS, DOPADDING and BAUD
 options can be specified in environment variables):

 Put each option you want set in the first column:

 -option	Sets the option
 --option	Clears the option

 -mid		Cursor is recentered when scrolling is necessary

 -marking	Text between ^KB and cursor is highlighted (use with -lightoff)

 -asis		Characters 128 - 255 shown as-is

 -force		Force final newline when files are saved

 -nobackups	If you don't want backup files to be created

 -lightoff	Turn off highlighting after block copy or move

 -exask		^KX always confirms file name

 -beep		Beep on errors and when cursor goes past extremes

 -nosta		Disable top-most status line

 -keepup	%k and %c status line escape sequences updated frequently

 -pg nnn	No. lines to keep for PgUp/PgDn

 -csmode	^KF after a pervious search does a ^L instead

 -backpath path Directory to store backup files

 -nonotice	Disable copyright notice

 -noxon		Attempt to turn off ^S/^Q processing

 -orphan	Put extra files given on command line in orphaned buffers
		instead of in windows

 -dopadding	Output pad characters (for when there is no tty handshaking)

 -lines nnn	Set no. screen lines

 -baud nnn	Set baud rate for terminal optimizations

 -columns nnn	Set no. screen columns

 -help		Start with help on

 -skiptop nnn	Don't use top nnn lines of the screen

 Status line definition strings.  -lmsg defines the left-justified string and
 -rmsg defines the right-justified string.  The first character of -rmsg is
 the background fill character.  The following escape sequences can be used
 in these strings:

  %t  12 hour time
  %u  24 hour time
  %T  O for overtype mode, I for insert mode
  %W  W if wordwrap is enabled
  %I  A if autoindent is enabled
  %X  Rectangle mode indicator
  %n  File name
  %m  '(Modified)' if file has been changed
  %*  '*' if file has been changed
  %R  Read-only indicator
  %r  Row (line) number
  %c  Column number
  %o  Byte offset into file
  %O  Byte offset into file in hex
  %a  Ascii value of character under cursor
  %A  Ascii value of character under cursor in hex
  %p  Percent of file cursor is at
  %l  No. lines in file
  %k  Entered prefix keys
  %S  '*SHELL*' if there is a shell running in window
  %M  Macro recording message

 These formatting escape sequences may also be given:
 
  \i  Inverse
  \u  Underline
  \b  Bold
  \d  Dim
  \f  Blink

-lmsg \i%k%T%W%I%X %n %m%R %M
-rmsg  %S Row %r Col %c %t  Ctrl-K H for help

 SECOND SECTION: File name dependant local option settings:

 Each line with '*' in the first column indicates the modes which should be
 set for files which match the regular expression.  If more than one regular
 expression matches the file name, then the last matching one is chosen.

 Here are the modes which can be set:

	-wordwrap		Wordwrap

	-autoindent		Auto indent

	-overwrite		Overtype mode

	-lmargin nnn		Left margin

	-rmargin nnn		Right margin

	-tab nnn		Tab width

	-indentc nnn		Indentation character (32 for space, 9 for tab)

	-istep nnn		Number of indentation columns

	-french			One space after '.', '?' and '!' for wordwrap
				and paragraph reformat instead of two.  Joe
				does not change the spacing you give, but
				sometimes it must put spacing in itself.  This
				selects how much is inserted.

	-spaces			TAB inserts spaces instead of tabs.

	-linums			Enable line numbers on each line

	-rdonly			File is read-only

	-keymap name		Keymap to use if not 'main'

	-lmsg			Status line definition strings-
	-rmsg			see previous section for more info.

	-mnew macro		Macro to execute when new files are loaded
	-mold macro		Macro to execute when existing files are loaded
	-msnew macro		Macro to execute when new files are saved
	-msold macro		Macro to execute when existing files are saved

	Macros for the above options are in the same format as in the key
	binding section below- but without the key name strings.

*
-wordwrap

*.c
-mnew rtn,"/* This is a C file */",rtn
-autoindent

*.h
-autoindent

*akefile
*AKEFILE
*rc

*.p
-autoindent

 THIRD SECTION: Named help screens:

 Use \i to turn on/off inverse video
 Use \u to turn on/off underline
 Use \b to turn on/off bold
 Use \d to turn on/off dim
 Use \f to turn on/off flash

 FOURTH SECTION: Key bindings:

 Keys:

 Use ^@@ through ^_ and ^? for Ctrl chars

	.kr		Right
	.kh		Home
	.kH		End

 You can also use termcap string capability names. For example:
d280 2
a281 2
 Simple macros can be made by comma seperating two or more command names.
 For example:
d283 1
a283 1
 eof,bol	^T Z		Goto beginning of last line
d285 1
a285 1
 Also quoted matter is typed in literally (backslashes escape):
d289 1
a289 7
 Macros may cross lines if they end with a comma.
 Commands or named macros may be created with :def.
 For example, you can use...

 :def foo eof,bol

 ... to define a command foo which will go to the beginning of the last line.
