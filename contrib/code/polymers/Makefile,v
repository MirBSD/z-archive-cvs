@Add a program I am working on for my polymers course.

This program calculates a conformation of a hypothetical polymer chain.
It creates an output file with the full conformation data and outputs
the length of the end-to-end vector on stdout.

The premises are:

 * The number of steps (=monomers) is fixed (via a define)
 * The length of a monomer is fixed
 * The direction of any segment is arbitrary
 * The direction is calculated in two dimensions, collisions are allowed
