@ca-bundle (20160212) wtf; urgency=high

  The removal of the 1024-bit roots may leave users of older OpenSSL
  versions unable to connect to some sites such as www.benefind.de –
  if this happens, consider applying the following patch:

  https://www.mirbsd.org/cvs.cgi/src/lib/libssl/src/crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c.diff?r1=1.5;r2=1.6

  The patch will cause OpenSSL to accept any and all certificates in
  the trust store as valid instead of using the provided certificate
  chain up to its root (some newer roots we still ship were additio‐
  nally cross-signed by a 1024-bit root causing this issue when pre‐
  sent in a certificate chain delivered by the SSL server).
