1.1
log
@update and fix various mirrors:

update:
• jessie: use httpredir, as in m-s
• stretch/buster: use deb.d.o ""
• bullseye: has backports already (probably contentless, but hey)
• precise: still on archive.u.c and more recent there

fix:
• wheezy/jessie: D25backports added bad sources.list line
• jessie: backports are archived already
• cosmic: still on archive.u.c but not on old-releases.u.c

also introduce D26backportsloppy
