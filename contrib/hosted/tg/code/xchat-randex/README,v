@attempt to build both a HexChat plugin and an XChat plugin

HexChat support by Vutral, although I chose to not use hexchat_plugin.h
@
text
@Notes:

* randex_h.{so,dll} is for HexChat;
  randex_x.{so,dll} is for XChat.

* Microsoft C is currently not supported. Use Cygwin.

* Define BE_QUIET=1 on the make(1) command line to inhibit printing
  information each time someone makes RANDEX with you.

* see main.c for copyright and licencing information

* arc4random.c is no longer part of the source code tarball, it was an
  accident, as it's developed independently. Retrieve it from:
  + https://www.mirbsd.org/MirOS/dist/hosted/other/arc4random.c
  Note that the file is versioned but uncompressed and thus not signed.
  Anonymous CVS is an option.

  This file is required at least on Win32 and some GNU platforms.

Supported commands (with examples):

* /RANDEX nick
  /RANDEX #channel
  /RANDEX *

  Initiate the RANDEX protocol with the nick/channel given, or
  the current channel ('*')

* /RANDFILE C:\PUTTY.RNG

  Read the file into the entropy pool, then save 600 bytes of
  entropy into that file.

* /RANDSTIR

  Stir the pool, i.e. request new entropy from the kernel.

* /RANDOM

  Display a 32-bit random number (hexadecimal and decimal).

so make it a compile-time define)

@let /randfile write 600 byte files, safe to use as ~/.gnupg/random_seed

XXX todo XXX
• actually default to that file (irssi)
• use oaathash ipv adler32 (irssi, xchat, tinyirc, sirc)
• link to homepage, which should be written first though…

@reduce the amount of code duplication wrt. arc4random.c while waiting for
the 500 mg Acetylsalicylacid to kick in:
• BSD::arc4random has it from contrib/code/Snippets/arc4random.c which is
  tagged alongside releases and pulled in via CVS module since it must be
  included in CPAN uploads
• xchat-randex should never had had it as part of the source tarball; the
  README file now points out where it can be retrieved from
• MirMake yet uses a different file, so it’s not touched
