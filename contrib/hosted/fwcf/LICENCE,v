@initial skeleton:

first will be two programmes, mkfwcf and unfwcf, which operate
similar to pkzip and pkunzip; code will be designed to be re-
usable by the later fwcfctl programme.

mkfwcf and unfwcf will be designed to run on MirOS (and OpenBSD);
GNU/Linux compatibility is not a design criterium.
