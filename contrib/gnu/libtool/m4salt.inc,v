# AC_HELP_STRING(LHS, RHS, [COLUMN])
# ----------------------------------
#
# Format a help string so that it looks pretty when
# the user executes "script --help".  This macro takes three
# arguments, a "left hand side" (LHS), a "right hand side" (RHS), and
# the COLUMN which is a string of white spaces which leads to the
# the RHS column (default: 26 white spaces).
#
# The resulting string is suitable for use in other macros that require
# a help string (e.g. AC_ARG_WITH).
#
# Here is the sample string from the Autoconf manual (Node: External
# Software) which shows the proper spacing for help strings.
#
#    --with-readline         support fancy command line editing
#  ^ ^                       ^
#  | |                       |
#  | column 2                column 26
#  |
#  column 0
#
# A help string is made up of a "left hand side" (LHS) and a "right
# hand side" (RHS).  In the example above, the LHS is
# "--with-readline", while the RHS is "support fancy command line
# editing".
#
# If the LHS is contains more than (COLUMN - 3) characters, then the LHS
# is terminated with a newline so that the RHS starts on a line of its
# own beginning with COLUMN.  In the default case, this corresponds to
# an LHS with more than 23 characters.
#
# Therefore, in the example, if the LHS were instead
# "--with-readline-blah-blah-blah", then the AS_HELP_STRING macro would
# expand into:
#
#
#    --with-readline-blah-blah-blah
#  ^ ^                       support fancy command line editing
#  | |                       ^
#  | column 2                |
#  column 0                  column 26
