@Today I accidentally typed an “em dash” (—) and noted that it's the same
glyph in fixed-misc as is the “horizontal bar” (―), which I had added to
KBDmir2U as a kind of “box drawing character” pun¹, but to what I looked
the semantics up then. Turns out it's just a mere dash. D'oh.

Ok, the definition of KBDmir2U prescribes a dash here – but which one to
use? Should I use the “em dash” which is more widely supported, or maybe
the “en dash” which is even more commonly used? (The “space ndash space”
combination is actually heavily used in German typography instead of the
single “mdash” without spaces around it – and in fixed-misc, this indeed
does make sense.)

I'd wanted to have asked bsiegert@@ about his opinion, but his cell phone
wasn't answered. Then I noticed, while debugging ICQ charset (centericq,
from MirPorts, is correct; ciruZ' py-tICQ wasn't), I noticed that all of
the directly typable (no Compose) codepoints except that one are suppor-
ted in the windows-1252² charset… and the en dash is, the em dash isn't.

Not that that would've been influencing me though… but I remember having
typed U+2013 manually (using the jupp ‘`’ command) quite often recently;
so the change went in. This is still KBDmir2U (revision 2 stepping B) as
the layout spec hasn't changed (even though it was my intention to place
a block drawing character there, why only one, why not more…).

Okay. What's not in ISO-8859-1? Easy³: --> …€„™“”•–Ÿ <--

I took the opportunity to clean up some of the comments – even fixed the
build instructions – and regenerate the kbd-layout sample text file (the
japanese section still talks about Attic/dot.Xmodmap.us_jp,v though, but
that isn't too bad either, I just use Kana,v at the moment). Also, in NT
the Ctrl-Tab combo now yields tab (hooray for these who use GNU screen's
split function within e.g. PuTTY and can't let loose Ctrl quickly enough
when switching between them).

Hm. I originally intended to write more here, and more detailledly. But,
being back from a week full of $ork, I guess I've deserved my beer now ☺

this file could be enhanced by the actual utf-8 representation
of the character in a third, and the name of the character in
a fourth column (even CJK); any volunteers?

the other mechanically via mksh. They're both well-formed XML for

(that's why missing some entities which would only be legal in either).
