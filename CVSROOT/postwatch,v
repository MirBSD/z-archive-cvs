@# The "postwatch" file is called after any command finishes writing new
# file attribute (watch/edit) information in a directory.
#
# If any format strings are present in the filter, they will be replaced
# as follows:
#    %c = canonical name of the command being executed
#    %I = unique (randomly generated) commit ID
#    %R = the name of the referrer, if any, otherwise the value NONE
#    %p = path relative to repository
#    %r = repository (path portion of $CVSROOT)
#
# The first entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
# against the directory that the change is being committed to, relative
# to the $CVSROOT.  For the first match that is found, then the remainder
# of the line is the name of the filter to run.
#
# If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions in this
# file, the "DEFAULT" line is used, if it is specified.
#
# If the name "ALL" appears as a regular expression it is always used
# in addition to the first matching regex or "DEFAULT".
