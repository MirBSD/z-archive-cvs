# Set 'SystemAuth' to 'no' if pserver shouldn't check system users/passwords.
SystemAuth=no

# Set 'LocalKeyword' to specify a local alias for a standard keyword.
#LocalKeyword=MYCVS=CVSHeader
LocalKeyword=MirOS=CVSHeader

# Set 'KeywordExpand' to 'i' followed by a list of keywords to expand or
# 'e' followed by a list of keywords to not expand.
#KeywordExpand=iMYCVS,Name,Date,Mdocdate
#KeywordExpand=eCVSHeader
KeywordExpand=iMirOS,Mdocdate

# Set 'TopLevelAdmin' to 'yes' to create a CVS directory at the top
# level of the new working directory when using the 'cvs checkout'
# command.
#TopLevelAdmin=no

# Put CVS lock files in this directory rather than directly in the repository.
#LockDir=/var/lock/cvs

# Set 'LogHistory' to 'all' or 'TOEFWUPCGMAR' to log all transactions to the
# history file, or a subset as needed (ie 'TMAR' logs all write operations)
#LogHistory=TOEFWUPCGMAR
LogHistory=TMAR

# Set 'RereadLogAfterVerify' to 'always' (the default) to allow the verifymsg
# script to change the log message.  Set it to 'stat' to force CVS to verify
# that the file has changed before reading it (this can take up to an extra
# second per directory being committed, so it is not recommended for large
# repositories.  Set it to 'never' (the previous CVS behavior) to prevent
# verifymsg scripts from changing the log message.
#RereadLogAfterVerify=always
RereadLogAfterVerify=never

# Set 'UserAdminOptions' to the list of 'cvs admin' commands (options)
# that users not in the '_cvsadmin' group are allowed to run.  This
# defaults to 'k', or only allowing the changing of the default
# keyword expansion mode for files for users not in the '_cvsadmin' group.
# This value is ignored if the '_cvsadmin' group does not exist.
#
# The following string would enable all 'cvs admin' commands for all
# users:
#UserAdminOptions=aAbceIklLmnNostuU
UserAdminOptions=ks

# Set 'UseNewInfoFmtStrings' to 'no' if you must support a legacy system by
# enabling the deprecated old style info file command line format strings.
# Be warned that these strings could be disabled in any new version of CVS.
UseNewInfoFmtStrings=yes

# Set 'ImportNewFilesToVendorBranchOnly' to 'yes' if you wish to force
# every 'cvs import' command to behave as if the '-X' flag was
# specified.
#ImportNewFilesToVendorBranchOnly=no

# Set 'PrimaryServer' to the CVSROOT to the primary, or write, server when
# establishing one or more read-only mirrors which serve as proxies for
# the write server in write mode or redirect the client to the primary for
# write requests.
#
# For example:
#
#   PrimaryServer=:fork:localhost/cvsroot

# Set 'MaxProxyBufferSize' to the the maximum allowable secondary
# buffer memory cache size before the buffer begins being stored to disk, in
# bytes.  Must be a positive integer but may end in 'K', 'M', 'G', or 'T' (for
# Kibi, Mebi, Gibi, & Tebi, respectively).  If an otherwise valid number you
# specify is greater than the SIZE_MAX defined by your system's C compiler,
# then it will be resolved to SIZE_MAX without a warning.  Defaults to 8M (8
# Mebibytes). The 'i' from 'Ki', 'Mi', etc. is omitted.
#
# High values for MaxProxyBufferSize may speed up a secondary server
# with old hardware and a lot of available memory but can actually slow a
# modern system down slightly.
#
# For example:
#
#   MaxProxyBufferSize=1G

# Set 'MaxCommentLeaderLength' to the maximum length permitted for the
# automagically determined comment leader used when expanding the Log
# keyword, in bytes.  CVS's behavior when the automagically determined
# comment leader exceeds this length is dependent on the value of
# 'UseArchiveCommentLeader' set in this file.  'unlimited' is a valid
# setting for this value.  Defaults to 20 bytes.
#
# For example:
#
#   MaxCommentLeaderLength=20

# Set 'UseArchiveCommentLeader' to 'yes' to cause CVS to fall back on
# the comment leader set in the RCS archive file, if any, when the
# automagically determined comment leader exceeds 'MaxCommentLeaderLength'
# bytes.  If 'UseArchiveCommentLeader' is not set and a comment leader
# greater than 'MaxCommentLeaderLength' is calculated, the Log keyword
# being examined will not be expanded.  Defaults to 'no'.
#
# For example:
#
#   UseArchiveCommentLeader=no

@This commit is dedicated to all the people who helped me to work on
MirBSD in the past, thus forming the MirOS Project with me. In par-
ticular, these are Benny Siegert, Waldemar Brodkorb, Stephen Paska-
luk, although the people who've only contributed a bit are not for-
gotten either.

Change the default CVS tag we use to $\MirOS$ and prevent expansion
of all other RCS and CVS keywords by default, to not impact code we
imported from other projects.
