@# The "verifymsg" file is used to allow verification of logging
# information.  It works best when a template (as specified in the
# rcsinfo file) is provided for the logging procedure.  Given a
# template with locations for, a bug-id number, a list of people who
# reviewed the code before it can be checked in, and an external
# process to catalog the differences that were code reviewed, the
# following test can be applied to the code:
#
#   Making sure that the entered bug-id number is correct.
#   Validating that the code that was reviewed is indeed the code being
#       checked in (using the bug-id number or a separate review
#       number to identify this particular code set.).
#
# If any of the above test failed, then the commit would be aborted.
#
# Format strings present in the filter will be replaced as follows:
#    %c = canonical name of the command being executed
#    %I = unique (randomly generated) commit ID
#    %R = the name of the referrer, if any, otherwise the value NONE
#    %p = path relative to repository
#    %r = repository (path portion of $CVSROOT)
#    %l = name of log file to be verified.
#
# If no format strings are present in the filter, a default " %l" will
# be appended to the filter, but this usage is deprecated.
#
# Actions such as mailing a copy of the report to each reviewer are
# better handled by an entry in the loginfo file.
#
# One thing that should be noted is the the ALL keyword is not
# supported.  There can be only one entry that matches a given
# repository.
