@Palm-Bookmarks transforms a bookmarks tree into a list of records
where each record looks like this: category, name, location,
description. The name, location and description are directly
copied from Netscape terminology. Each record corresponds to one
bookmark. The category is determined by the first list of folders
(the ones you see when you click down the bookmarks menu). A
record gets as a category the name of the folder from this list
it is placed in.  This way information is lost as subfolders are
ignored. The reason for this is that the program ListDB on the
palm support only one level of categorisation.
