@PilRC is an application that takes a resource script file and generates
one or more binary resource files that are to be used when developing
for the Palm Computing Platform.  PilRCUI gives you a preview of your
resource file.

Package can be built with the no_x11 flavour which does not include
PilRCUI and does not need X11.
