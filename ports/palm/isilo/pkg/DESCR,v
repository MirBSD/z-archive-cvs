@iSilo converts text or HTML documents to the Palm Pilot .pdb
format.  These can then be installed on a Palm Pilot, using
tools in the comms/pilot-link port.

These files are only readable using the iSilo reader,
available from the web site.  A free reader exists, as does
a more featureful shareware reader.  Their primary
advantages over other Palm Pilot DOC readers are

  1. Internal links in the original HTML are maintained.

  2. A reasonable facsimile of the original HTML formatting
  is maintained.

  3. Images in the original HTML file are dithered and
  scaled, for viewing on the Pilot.
