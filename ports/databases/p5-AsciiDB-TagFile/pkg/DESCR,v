@Usually when you have to store persistent data you don't need a full-blown
database server, just a ASCII database would do the trick.

AsciiDB::Tag allows you to access a simple ASCII database using a
perl hash variable. The database format is straightforward so you can edit
it by hand if you need so. Each record is stored into a file, and a
record is just a set of values tagged by the field name:

       [Name]: Jose A. Rodriguez
       [Address]: Granollers, Barcelona, SPAIN

The tie class provides a convenient way to read and update this kind
of ASCII databases.
