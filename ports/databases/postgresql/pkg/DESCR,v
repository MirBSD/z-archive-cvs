log
@Re-shuffle the packages, bump patchlevel. Untested.

Rationale: MirPorts installs all subpackages by default. However, the old
-clients subpackage conflicted with the main package. Now, the main package
contains the clients, and the server is in the -server subpackage, which
needs the main pkg.

@PostgreSQL is an Object-Relational Database Management System.  It
supports almost all SQL constructs, including transactions, subselects,
and user-defined types and functions. Write-ahead logging means
increased performance while retaining data integrity.

The MirPorts PostgreSQL port build produces several packages:

* postgresql-${VERSION} - client-side applications and headers
  Contains everything but the actual backend (the server)

* postgresql-server-${VERSION} - database server
  Contains only the backend, i.e. the server daemon.

* postgresql-docs-${VERSION} - documentation
  Additional documentation: FAQs, READMEs; PostgreSQL manuals in
  HTML format: Administrator's Guide, Programmer's Manual, PostgreSQL
  Tutorial and User's Guide and Integrated Documentation package
  contains all the above documentation.
