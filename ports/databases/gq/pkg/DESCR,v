Features include:

 * LDAP browser
 * LDAP V3 Schema browser
 * Template builder
 * Export subtree or whole server to LDIF
 * Use any number of servers
 * Search based on single argument or LDAP filter
 * Edit and delete entries
 * Add entries using an existing entry, or based on your own template
 * Supports LDAP syntaxes and special attributes by presenting them in a custom
   way. Currently there are custom "displaytypes" for jpegPhoto, userPassword
