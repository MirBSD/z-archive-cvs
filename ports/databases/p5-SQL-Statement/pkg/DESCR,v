@The SQL::Statement module implements a small, abstract SQL engine.  By
parsing an SQL query you create an SQL::Statement instance. This instance
offers methods for retrieving syntax, for WHERE clause and statement
evaluation.  The implementation is designed to work with the DBI driver
DBD::CSV, and should be easily extensible.
