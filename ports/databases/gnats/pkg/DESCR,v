@GNATS is a bug-tracking tool designed for use at a central support
site.  Software users who experience problems use electronic mail
to communicate these problems to the maintainers of that software;
GNATS partially automates the tracking of these problems by:

- organizing problem reports into a database and notifying responsible
  parties of suspected bugs;

- allowing support personnel and their managers to edit, query and
  report on accumulated bugs; and

- providing a reliable archive of problems with a given program and a
  history of the life of the program by preserving its reported
  problems and their subsequent solutions.
