1.2
log
@commit an updated zsh, mostly taken from OpenBSD, with a few MirBSD
modifications â€“ just so that it compiles, runs, and almost passes the
testsuite (MidnightBSD and Interix will need more patches; Darwin should
work as-is).

MirBSD testsuite results:
37 successful test scripts, 1 failure, 0 skipped

The reason for this file is documented at the bottom of ./SECURITY
because it led to discovering (at least) one buffer overflow hole
in the multibyte code (and to me not wanting to poke in this code
any longer).
