@commit an updated zsh, mostly taken from OpenBSD, with a few MirBSD
modifications â€“ just so that it compiles, runs, and almost passes the
testsuite (MidnightBSD and Interix will need more patches; Darwin should
work as-is).

MirBSD testsuite results:
37 successful test scripts, 1 failure, 0 skipped

The reason for this file is documented at the bottom of ./SECURITY
because it led to discovering (at least) one buffer overflow hole
in the multibyte code (and to me not wanting to poke in this code
any longer).

@Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) which of the standard shells
most resembles the Korn shell (ksh), although it is not completely
compatible.  It includes enhancements of many types, notably in the
command-line editor, options for customising its behaviour, filename
globbing, features to make C-shell (csh) users feel more at home and
extra features drawn from tcsh (another `custom' shell).
