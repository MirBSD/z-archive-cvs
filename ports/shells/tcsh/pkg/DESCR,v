Tcsh is an enhanced, but completely compatible version of the Berkeley
UNIX C shell (csh). It is a command language interpreter usable both as
an interactive login shell and a shell script command processor. It
includes a command-line editor, programmable word completion, spelling
correction, a history mechanism, job control and a C-like syntax.
