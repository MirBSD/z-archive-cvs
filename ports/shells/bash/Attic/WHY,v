@don't play a politician... people should know that mksh rules anyway,
and these who don't can't be helped (besides, this port needs update)

@The GNU bash port is voluntarily broken / disabled.

This is not because of code issues - it's fine to use
the GNU bash as shell for regular users. It has dif-
ferent reasons.

Users are unfamiliar with /bin/csh, the default shell
for BSD. They already know the GNU bash and install
it. This would not be a problem if the GNU bash were
part of the base system, residing in /bin, statically
linked, etc. but it is not for a REASON.

We ship another shell - /bin/ksh - which is in the
base system, has tab completion, is bourne shell
compatible and even security audited like csh (which
the GNU bash is not). Please use ksh instead.

If you know what you're doing, override the BROKEN
tag on the make(1) command line.
