@Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne Again SHell, an sh-compatible
command language interpreter that executes commands read from the
standard input or from a file.  Bash also incorporates useful
features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).

Bash is intended to be a conformant implementation of the IEEE POSIX
Shell and Tools specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).
