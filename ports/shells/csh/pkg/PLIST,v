@• csh: this one always felt missing, if not to serve as bad example, then
  as build dependency for a few ports; distfile's mirrored at our master
  site for the sake of history-completeness and good karma (wtf, it's NLSd?
  well, not multibyte capable though)
• heirloom-sh: why not let us feel the wrath of a true bourne shell, akin
  to the Slowlartus /bin/sh, on a modern OS? It's said to come with multi-
  byte capabilities, but apparently not in the command line editor… but at
  least, unlike NetBSD® /bin/sh (POSIX, not Bourne, compatible ash) this
  one doesn't use strcpy(3) any more
