|  minicom is installed with permissions set at 555.
|
|  To allow users to run minicom, you should put them in group dialer.
|
|  If you wish to use ${SYSCONFDIR}/minicom/minicom.users to restrict
|  user behaviour to specific configurations or ports, then you
|  must change the permissions on ${PREFIX}/bin/minicom to be mode 4551
|  owned by uucp:dialer and *not* put users in group dialer.
