@Pilot-link is a series of tools designed to extract and add data to a
PalmPilot organizer.  There are programs in here to transfer data, debug
the pilot, synchronize with calendars, and a set of include files and
libraries with which you may build your own applications in C, C++,
Perl5, Tcl, Java, and Python.
