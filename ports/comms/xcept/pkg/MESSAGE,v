@After installing this package, you must create
${SYSCONFDIR}/cept.init ${SYSCONFDIR}/cept.users files.

Samples exist in ${PREFIX}/share/cept.

You must also add

xcept		20005/tcp #XCEPT

to /etc/services, add an '_xcept' user in your system with uid 522
and put the user in group 'dialer', then put the line

xcept	stream	tcp	nowait	_xcept	${PREFIX}/libexec/ceptd ceptd

in /etc/inetd.conf on your server host, and restart inetd.

Note that running this software as root as advised in the
distribution can present a serious security risk to your system.
