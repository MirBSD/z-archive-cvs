log
@Add three perl modules I played with today while I should have been
working. I use Device::Gsm for reading and sending SMS messages. My
phone only speaks PDU mode, where you work with hexdumps of your
messages (with a special header). I was too lazy to write a decoding
routine, so I used this perl module :).
