@Add three perl modules I played with today while I should have been
working. I use Device::Gsm for reading and sending SMS messages. My
phone only speaks PDU mode, where you work with hexdumps of your
messages (with a special header). I was too lazy to write a decoding
routine, so I used this perl module :).

@This is a POSIX-based version of the Win32::Serialport module ported by
Joe Doss for the MisterHouse Home Automation Package from Version 0.08
of the Win32 module. He replaced calls to the Win32 API with similar
functions implemented using POSIX calls. While most of the testing has
occurred on linux, the package should work on other POSIX-compliant
Operating Systems.
