log
@Add three perl modules I played with today while I should have been
working. I use Device::Gsm for reading and sending SMS messages. My
phone only speaks PDU mode, where you work with hexdumps of your
messages (with a special header). I was too lazy to write a decoding
routine, so I used this perl module :).

text
@This module works as an interface to GSM phones or GSM modems connected
on your local serial ports.

It can control your GSM *standard* functions and status.
It can send SMS messages in a simple and convenient way.
It can read messages stored on your sim card.
