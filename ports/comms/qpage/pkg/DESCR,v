@Initial revision

@QuickPage sends messages to a paging terminal using the SNPP and IXO
(also known as TAP) protocols.  It is normally used with no options
other than a recipient and the message text, in which case the message
is sent to the SNPP server where it is submitted to a page queue to be
sent by a separate daemon process.

Page groups and duty schedules are supported.  Status notification
messages indicating the success or failure of a page are sent via
e-mail to submitters of high-priority (level 0) pages.
