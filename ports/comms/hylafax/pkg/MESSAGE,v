@Congratulations, HylaFAX has been installed!

It now needs some manual configuration before it is usable.

Setting up: (for the impatient)

	Invoke ${PREFIX}/sbin/faxsetup to interactively configure it.
	When you are asked to specify the name of tty device, use a
	tty device existing on your architecture instead of "ttyd1".

	Consult ${PREFIX}/lib/fax/hylafax.sh.sample for an example
	of what to put in /etc/rc.local.

	For accepting incoming FAX/data calls, modify /etc/ttys(5) to
	contain something like this:

	    cua00	"${PREFIX}/sbin/faxgetty"	dialup	on

	and send a SIGHUP to init(8).

Documentation: (for the methodical)

	On Line Manuals: 	man hylafax
	World Wide Web site:	http://www.hylafax.org/
