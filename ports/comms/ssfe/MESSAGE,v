@The SCO/386BSD/FreeBSD/MidnightBSD syscons(4) driver and the NT console
driver of Interix do not have the ‘cs’ termcap(5) capability and thusly
cannot run ssfe. To use ssfe, use pcvt(4), wscons, a real hardware ter-
minal (e.g. DEC VT420) on serial console, or some other terminal emula-
tor like xterm or GNU screen (from ports/misc/screen).
