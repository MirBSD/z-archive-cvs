@The SCO/386BSD/FreeBSD/MidnightBSD syscons(4) driver and the NT console
driver of Interix do not have the ‘cs’ termcap(5) capability and thusly
cannot run ssfe. To use ssfe, use pcvt(4), wscons, a real hardware ter-
minal (e.g. DEC VT420) on serial console, or some other terminal emula-
tor like xterm or GNU screen (from ports/misc/screen).

@<stevan_tiefert_m:#MidnightBSD> thinks that we should users unable to run
ssfe on their syscons terminal (mnbsd is dropping pcvt, and the 386BSD-
derived family stays with SCO syscons instead of using NetBSD® wscons; the
native NT console used by Interix has similar issues, but luckily, Interix
already comes with an X11R5 xterm capable enough – if you have an X server,
that is)
