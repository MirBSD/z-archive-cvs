@ssfe(1) is the Sirc Screen Front-End (or Split Screen Front-End),
which runs a line-oriented program in the background and provides
a full screen interface for it.  The bottom line of the screen is
the input line which supports emacs-style command line editing; a
status bar is shown above, and on top, the background programme's
output is shown in a scrolling area.

ssfe can be configured to change between raw/cooked/irc mode, re-
display the input, word-wrap the output, and supports a protocol,
facilitating basic communication between ssfe and the programe.
