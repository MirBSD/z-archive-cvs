@Initial revision

@Wy60 can be invoked from within any one of many commonly used
terminal emulators as long as there is a working terminfo entry for
it.  It sets up a emulation environment converting between Wyse 60
escape sequences and the escape codes of the host system, and
launches a shell to run within this emulated environment.

The current set of supported escape sequences is limited, but should
suffice to run many existing legacy applications without requiring
any changes.
