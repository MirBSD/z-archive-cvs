@This is a bare bones utility to enable people who have Palm OS devices to
sync to Mobile Application Link (MAL) compliant servers.  AvantGo
(www.avantgo.com) and Puma Technologies (www.pumatech.com) are the first
two companies committing to producing servers which speak this protocol.
This utility will allow a user to sync with multiple servers,
simultaneously or separately. The AvantGo.com service (www.avantgo.com)  
is the first such server.
