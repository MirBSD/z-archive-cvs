@Implement a new parameter: pkg_delete -C, will be used for pkg_upgrade IDC.

From the manpage:
     -C      Only delete configuration files that have the same checksum as
             the original file, i.e. those that have not been changed by the
             user.

@Implement base package upgrades that actually work:

- add a -U option for pkg_delete to leave the files but unregister the
  package. Update manpage; while here, sort options alphabetically.
- add base package detection code into pkg_upgrade

Please test this, as I haven't done so :).
