@add an ld(1) wrapper which provides --library-after=X as new option,
which works like --library-path=X (-LX), install the wrapper and use
it for ${LOCALBASE}/lib and (USE_X11=Yes) ${X11BASE}/lib

now curl 7.15.4 can be built while curl 7.15.1 (missing function
in /usr/mpkg/lib/libcurl.so.something which is new in the new version)
