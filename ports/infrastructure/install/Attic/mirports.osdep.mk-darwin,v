@half-hearted attempt to unify LOCALBASE to /usr/mpkg for all platforms
agreed some time ago bsiegert@@
no veto on miros-discuss@@

for now, hardcode PREFIX to /usr/local for imake and old-install ports
(we should probably do something about imake anyway, regarding both
Interix and Darwin - maybe require our own XFree86® port, but later...)

some of the code (especially shell and make) will be rewritten now,
since it can be simplified (nuking bugs, maybe)

what about changing /etc/mk.conf as well (conflict with obsd and maybe
others)? I think of /etc/${MAKE}.cfg (MAKE=make or mmake) maybe?

please test, as usual...
