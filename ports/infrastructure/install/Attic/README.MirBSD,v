MirPorts sysmake files for old MirOS
====================================

mk.conf
-------

After updating, your /etc/mk.conf contains some entries under
the label "#@@@@MIRPORTS user1" which used to be part of stock
/etc/mk.conf before 2005. Please review these and delete the
older default settings further up this file. The user settings
will not be overwritten by a later 'make setup' in contrast
to these marked by "#@@@@MIRPORTS start" (system settings).


Installation
------------

Please use the provided installer.
XXX fill in better


Adding support for ancient MirOS releases
-----------------------------------------

You might want to export certain variables to known values before
calling any MirPorts specific file. The best place to add such
patches would be /usr/share/mk/mirports.sys.mk just after the
call to <bsd.own.mk>.

In addition to that, you will have to add the necessary pieces
to /usr/ports/infrastructure/mk/mirports.osdep.mk for your revision.

Package tools
-------------
d17 2
a18 4
The package tools of MirOS #7quater are sufficiently recent
so that they work with the current version of MirPorts. On
older (MirOS #7ter) systems, you must build the new MirPorts
package tools, see below.
d20 2
a21 25
Systems older than MirOS #7ter are not supported, but might
work (MirOS #7bis will do).


Installing the MirPorts package tools
-------------------------------------

Go to the mpsup/pkgtools directory and issue the usual sequence
of make obj, make depend, make, sudo make install.


Patching the system Makefile includes
-------------------------------------

Copy the files in ports/infrastructure/compat/generic/ over their
corresponding (or non-existant) files in /usr/share/mk.

Then change to the directory ports/infrastructure/compat/miros/X
where X is your MirOS release, and apply the patches to the other
Makefiles. On systems older than MirOS #7ter you might have to
add other patches manually.

Finally, please copy ports/infrastructure/compat/miros/mirports.osdep.mk
to the directory /usr/ports/infrastructure/mk/ or whereever you placed
the MirPorts Framework.
