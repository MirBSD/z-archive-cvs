@gAcc is a program intended to manage one's bank accounts. It provides basic
functions such as :

- having multiple accounts in a wallet file
- user readable configuration file & wallets files
- add / remove any account from the file (happily ;-) )
- add / remove any operation from any account (idem :) )
- modify the category list
- point or un-point operations
- display intermediate balance for each operation
-  re-edit operations
- re-edit accounts
- internationalisation (not yet finished. volunteers ?) and locale formats
