Viz copies its input to its output, converting invisible characters
to a visible form.  If the -t option is used, the output is formatted
in a form that can be completely inverted by inviz, which allows
a binary file to be converted to a text form and then back.  It is
much more flexible than either cat -v or od (either old or POSIX
od), and it is also 2-4 times faster.
