@merged into GNU screen proper, cf. https://blog.steve.fi/tags/tscreen/

@Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical
terminal between several processes (typically interactive shells).
Each virtual terminal provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal
and, in addition, several control functions from the ANSI X3.64 (ISO
6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support for
multiple character sets). There is a scrollback history buffer for each
virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving text
regions between windows.

This version of GNU screen is capable of auto-detecting whether it's
being run on a terminal with ISO 8859, UTF-8 or other encoding, as if
running wsconfig(8) -U or ports/sysutils/chkuterm on the tty.

This is actually tscreen, a fork off GNU screen's development branch,
with extra features added. It seems to be lacking some features though,
which to add back has been attempted by the MirPorter; sadly enough,
the nethack mode is missing.

Flavours:
	static - Build with statically linked binaries.
	shm - export screen as shared memory, useful for brltty.

@import tscreen, almost the same as screen, can do vertical split
and things but no nethack â˜¹
