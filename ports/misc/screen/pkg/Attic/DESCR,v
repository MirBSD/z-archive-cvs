@Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical
terminal between several processes (typically interactive shells).
Each virtual terminal provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal
and, in addition, several control functions from the ANSI X3.64 (ISO
6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support for
multiple character sets). There is a scrollback history buffer for each
virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving text
regions between windows.

This version of GNU screen is capable of auto-detecting whether it's
being run on a terminal with ISO 8859, UTF-8 or other encoding, as if
running wsconfig(8) -U or ports/sysutils/chkuterm on the tty.

Flavours:
	static - Build with statically linked binaries.
	shm - export screen as shared memory, useful for brltty.

@Functional changes:
* change 'deflogin' from on to off to match behaviour on non-MirOS systems
  or MirOS systems with suid screen to the default MirOS/MirPorts/non-suid
  behaviour (which cannot touch utmp)
* bump package patchlevel

Non-functional changes:
* Makefile: whitespace cleanup
* Makefile: change perl to ed(1)
* DESCR: we standardise on English spelling, not American
