@* bump patchlevel
* mention new 'chkuterm' and 'wsconfig(8) -U' like determination
  mechanism in the manual page
* mention that MirChanges are only documented in the manpage in the
  texinfo documentation
* etcscreenrc: sync spelling
* etcscreenrc: pad hours with a zero
* etcscreenrc: we always use UTF-8; people who want to have a latin1
  on the "inner" side can get by with "^A:utf8 off" - no need to set
  the LC_* environment variables since our setlocale(3) always returns
  en_US.UTF-8 anyway; use luit(1) for other encodings (which requires
  a utf-8 capable terminal emulator or screen inside though)
* screen.c: if the "inner" character set of the terminals, as determined
  by either the -U option or setlocale() and nl_langinfo(CODESET), returns
  ISO-8859-1 / C / US-ASCII or UTF-8, run a check like wsconfig(8) -U to
  see if we have UTF-8 (3), ISO-8859-1 (4) or something entirely different
  (like EUC-JP (1), 7bit ASCII (2), Shift-JIS (5) - the numbers in parens
  are the cursor position after outputting the determination string), and
  if we can determine UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1, use it, no matter what the maybe
  broken locale says; actual use case: DEC VT420 on MirOS-current (always
  UTF-8), uxterm on OpenBSD (always 'C' with latin1) or other systems that
  don't have locale support (especially embedded systems)
* screen.c: in the year 2147483648 I assume long is 64 bits alright
