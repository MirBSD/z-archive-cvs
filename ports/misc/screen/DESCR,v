@Quite a batch of changes:
• Correct rendering bugs in the manual page
• Apply bumpleft/bumpright/collapse patch
• Document these including keybindings; correct those (no Ctrl-{.,,})
• Use ISO 8601 date format, without “T”, for the status line
• Update wcwidth data from MirBSD base (and glibc git master) Unicode 10

@GNU screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical
terminal between several processes (typically interactive shells).
Each virtual terminal provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal
and, in addition, several control functions from the ANSI X3.64 (ISO
6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support for
multiple character sets). There is a scrollback history buffer for each
virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving text
regions between windows.

This version of GNU screen is capable of auto-detecting whether it's
being run on a terminal with ISO 8859, UTF-8 or other encoding, as if
running wsconfig(8) -U or ports/sysutils/chkuterm on the tty. It also
supports the bumpleft/bumpright and collapse commands.

Flavours:
	static - Build with statically linked binaries.
	shm - export screen as shared memory, useful for brltty.
