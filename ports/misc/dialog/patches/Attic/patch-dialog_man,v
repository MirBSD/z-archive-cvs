+.RB "A " gauge " box displays a meter along the bottom of the box.
 The meter indicates the percentage.  New percentages are read from
 standard input, one integer per line.  The meter is updated
 to reflect each new percentage.  If stdin is XXX, then the first
 line following is taken as an integer percentage, then subsequent
 lines up to another XXX are used for a new prompt.
-The guage exits when EOF is reached on stdin.
