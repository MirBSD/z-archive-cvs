@write an entirely new port of Tom Dickey’s (yeah the lynx man) “dialog”
utility, using wide curses and stuff like that

even newer than Debian sid ☺
@
text
@This application provides a method of displaying several different types
of dialog boxes from shell scripts.  This allows a developer of a script
to interact with the user in a much friendlier manner.

The following types of boxes are at your disposal:
•  yes/no           Typical query style box with "Yes" and "No" answer buttons
•  menu             A scrolling list of menu choices with single entry selection
•  input            Query style box with text entry field
•  message          Similar to the yes/no box, but with only an "Ok" button
•  text             A scrollable text box that works like a simple file viewer
•  info             A message display that allows asynchronous script execution
•  checklist        Similar to the menu box, but allowing multiple selections
•  radiolist        Checklist style box allowing single selections
•  gauge            Typical "progress report" style box
•  tail             Allows viewing the end of files (tail) that auto updates
•  background tail  Similar to tail but runs in the background.

Dialog is typically invoked from a shell script and puts nice
yes-no/checklist/radio-button - menues on your screen.
(Text is just passed on as arguments to dialog.)
