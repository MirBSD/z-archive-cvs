@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@KTimeclock is a personal timeclock to keep track of how much time is 
spent working on various projects and the tasks that they involve.
Simply set up a series of projects, each of which can contain multiple 
sub-projects and tasks; select the current task that you're working on;
start the clock; and KTimeclock will track the time you've spent working 
on that task.
