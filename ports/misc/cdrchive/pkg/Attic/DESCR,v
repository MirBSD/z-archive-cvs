@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@CD-Rchive is a Qt-based graphical CD creation tool.  It uses cdrecord,
mkisofs and cdda2wav, and has the ability to make data and audio CDs.
CD-Rchive also supports recording data and audio CDs "on the fly", and
mounting ISO images using vnconfig to check that the image is as it
should be.  CD-Rchive can be used to make bootable "El Torito" CDs.
