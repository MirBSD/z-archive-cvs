@by request of bsiegert@@, make all imake-using ports as only for MirOS and
OpenBSD, since they use the -DPorts logic of OpenBSD.cf/MirBSD.cf

since imake.port.mk would be too late, this means touching â€™em all

XXX these openbsd derived ports Makefiles surely look ugly

@Non-free dependency.

Explanation: A package is not for {CDROM,FTP} if not all of its dependencies
are allowed for {CDROM,FTP} as packages.

"Important" packages that are not allowed for CDROM are lame, postgresql,
gnuplot, and pine.
