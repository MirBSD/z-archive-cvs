@CLEX is a file manager with a full-screen user interface. It displays
directory contents including the file status details and provides
features like command history, filename insertion, or name completion
in order to help users to create commands to be executed by the shell.

There are no built-in commands, CLEX is an add-on to your favorite
shell.
