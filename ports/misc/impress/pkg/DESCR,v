@Fix build, overhaul DESCR, bump.

@ImPress is a WYSIWYG publishing and presentation tool.

It can also be used within a WWW browser (e.g. Netscape) that is capable
of running the Tcl Plugin.  The Tcl Plugin can be obtained from the web
site at: http://dev.scriptics.com/

ImPress can be significantly enhanced through use of several modified
utilities:

 * Pstoedit - Allows you to translate EPS files to Tk for ImPress use.
 * Font3D - Translates TrueType font strings to vectorized Tk.
 * Type1inst - Aids in maintaining Ghostscript Fontmaps and X11
   fonts.dir files.
