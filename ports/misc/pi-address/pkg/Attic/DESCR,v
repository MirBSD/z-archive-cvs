@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@pi-address is a GUI frontend to address databases from a 3Com
PalmPilot.  It can read/edit/save database files in PDB-format. Those
files can be read from or written to the pilot using "pilot-xfer" from
the pilot-link package.

The program can directly read/write the address data from/to the
Pilot.

The programm can also be used as a general address manager without a
3Com PalmPilot. Some of the record fields may be not very meaningful
in this case.
