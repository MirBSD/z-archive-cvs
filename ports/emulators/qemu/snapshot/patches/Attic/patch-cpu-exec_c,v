@new qemu, slight help from pkgsrc® here (website only shows RC…)

• sparc: regression against 0.10.1/linux – fdc probing results
  in a timeout and then an unexpected interrupt or something
  (probably skippable via UKC)
• i386: findcpuspeed division by zero, should be fixable

@add qemu-0.9.1 port snitched from openbsd, with most of our old patches
applied, and fixed to build with -Werror as well

pro:
• can netboot openbsd 3.9-current/amd64
• can _almost_ boot mirbsd #10/sparc (bsd.rd has issues with esp, bsd.net
  has none, except I have no rootfs handy ATM)
• can still boot MS-DOS
• said to be able to use kqemu – untested

con:
• regression: can *NOT* boot mirbsd #10/i386 any more
