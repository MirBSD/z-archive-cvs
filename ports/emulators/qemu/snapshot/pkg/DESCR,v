@… of course, kqemu got dropped upstream eventually anyway

text
@QEMU is a generic and open source processor emulator which
achieves a good emulation speed by using dynamic translation.

QEMU has two operating modes:

* Full system emulation. In this mode, QEMU emulates a full
  system (for example a PC), including a processor and various
  peripherials. It can be used to launch different Operating
  Systems without rebooting the PC or to debug system code.

* User mode emulation (Linux host only). In this mode, QEMU can
  launch Linux processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU.

This version works with kqemu 1.4 only.

1.1
log
@add qemu-0.9.1 port snitched from openbsd, with most of our old patches
applied, and fixed to build with -Werror as well

pro:
• can netboot openbsd 3.9-current/amd64
• can _almost_ boot mirbsd #10/sparc (bsd.rd has issues with esp, bsd.net
  has none, except I have no rootfs handy ATM)
• can still boot MS-DOS
• said to be able to use kqemu – untested

con:
• regression: can *NOT* boot mirbsd #10/i386 any more
