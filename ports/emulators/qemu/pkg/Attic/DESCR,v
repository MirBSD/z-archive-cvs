@QEMU is a generic and open source processor emulator which
achieves a good emulation speed by using dynamic translation.

QEMU has two operating modes:

* Full system emulation. In this mode, QEMU emulates a full
  system (for example a PC), including a processor and various
  peripherials. It can be used to launch different Operating
  Systems without rebooting the PC or to debug system code.

* User mode emulation (Linux host only). In this mode, QEMU can
  launch Linux processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU.
