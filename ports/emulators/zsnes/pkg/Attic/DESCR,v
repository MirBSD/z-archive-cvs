@• apply some patches from zsnes CVS
• fix some things, e.g. code placement in .data section
• allow loading gzip’d ROMs with ‘.gz’ extension
• on MirBSD, allow for loading gzip’d files (even split ROMs)
  when they have no ‘.gz’ extension too, using gzfopen(3)
• simplify the port
• honour our CFLAGS better
