@UAE allows you to run most of the available Amiga software. It is a
software emulation, meaning that no extra or special hardware is needed
to do this. The hardware of an Amiga is emulated accurately, so that Amiga
software is tricked into thinking it is running on the real thing, with
your computer's display, keyboard, harddisk and mouse taking the parts of
their emulated counterparts.
