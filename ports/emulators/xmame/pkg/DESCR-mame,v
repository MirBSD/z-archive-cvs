@MAME stands for Multi Arcade Machine Emulator. As the name suggests, it is
a program that emulates the hardware (and low-level firmware) of a massive
variety of arcade machines.

Packages can be built with additional FLAVOURs:

  x11:  built with x11 support (default).

  gl:   built with GL support.

  sdl:  built with SDL support.
        This FLAVOUR requires the sdl package.
