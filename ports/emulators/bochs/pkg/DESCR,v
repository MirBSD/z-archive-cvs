@Bochs is a portable x86 CPU emulation software that emulates
enough of the x86 CPU (by default it emulates 586 instruction set),
related AT hardware, and BIOS to run DOS, Windows 95/98, Minix 2.0 and
other OS's, all on your workstation.

Flavours:
	debug   - build with Bochs' internal debugging support
	i386    - emulate 386 instruction set
	i486    - emulate 486 instruction set
	i686    - emulate 686 instruction set
	x86_64  - emulate x86-64 instruction set
	smp     - build with support for SMP (2 CPUs)
	smp_4   - build with support for SMP (4 CPUs)
	smp_8   - build with support for SMP (8 CPUs)
	no_comp - do not build with compressed hard drive support
	no_mmx  - do not build with mmx support
	no_pci  - build with support for i440FX PCI chipset
	no_x11  - do not build with X support
