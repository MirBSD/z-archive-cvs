1.1
log
@Wine 1.0 port, mostly taken from pkgsrc®

request for help: there is probably something about mmap.c the only
thing preventing us from running this… similar to the issues outlined
in the FreeBSD wiki about Wine, but made harder due to W^X probably

This will almost certainly not work on MidnightBSD, have a hard time
working on OpenBSD (especially due to no VFORK_SHM there), is totally
untested on Darwin (and PFRAG.dylib is missing), and not for Interix;
I wonder if it would work on NetBSD® (it should) if MirPorts ran the-
re, but if so, it had IPX support, which theirs doesn’t ☺

	Correctly expand -pthread to -lpthread (for linking)
