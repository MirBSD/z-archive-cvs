@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@initial port of qemu-HEAD + qvm86-HEAD
* not tested, only a make-compile attempt
  -> pcnet and so on removed
* i386 -> i386 only
* kqemu/qvm86 support disabled for now
  (no attempt at porting the LKM has been done yet)
* untested if it still works

conflicts with qemu-* of course (bsiegert@@ please check the syntax :)
