@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@QEMU is a generic and open source processor emulator which
achieves a good emulation speed by using dynamic translation.

QEMU has two operating modes:

* Full system emulation. In this mode, QEMU emulates a full
  system (for example a PC), including a processor and various
  peripherials. It can be used to launch different Operating
  Systems without rebooting the PC or to debug system code.

* User mode emulation (Linux host only). In this mode, QEMU can
  launch Linux processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU.

QVM86 is a kernel module used to speed up i386 emulation on
an i386 host. It is currently disabled until ported.

@initial port of qemu-HEAD + qvm86-HEAD
* not tested, only a make-compile attempt
  -> pcnet and so on removed
* i386 -> i386 only
* kqemu/qvm86 support disabled for now
  (no attempt at porting the LKM has been done yet)
* untested if it still works

conflicts with qemu-* of course (bsiegert@@ please check the syntax :)
