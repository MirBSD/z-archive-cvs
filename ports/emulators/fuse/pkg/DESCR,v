@fuse is a free version of a ZX Spectrum emulator. It emulates
the 48K/128K/+2/+2A/+3 Speccy and Timex TC2048 machine, supports
loading from .tzx files, has sound and kempston joystick emulation,
and emulates various printers you could attach to the Spectrum.
It supports the new RZX input recording file format.
