@The SPICE3 Version3f3 User's Manual, a postscript document available
at ftp://ic.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/Spice3/um.3f3.ps says:

  SPICE is a general-purpose circuit  simulation  program for nonlinear dc,
  nonlinear transient, and linear ac analyses. Circuits may contain resistors,
  capacitors, inductors, mutual inductors, independent voltage and current
  sources, four types of dependent sources, lossless and lossy transmission
  lines (two separate implementations), switches, uniform distributed RC
  lines, and the five most common semiconductor devices: diodes, BJTs, JFETs,
  MESFETs, and MOSFETs.

With this release, the University of California will no longer
be providing technical support for Spice3, and no plans have been made
for providing support any time in the future.  Some work on Spice3 will
continue (notably the BSIM-3 model and perhaps other device models).
