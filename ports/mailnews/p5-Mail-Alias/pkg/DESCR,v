@This module allows direct manipulation of various types of e-mail
alias files.

The primary use of Mail::Alias is for manipulating alias files in
the SENDMAIL alias file format. Additionally it is possible to read
some other formats and to convert between various alias file formats.

The following actions are available:

o Set the name of the current aliases file being accessed
o Verify the presence of aliases
o Retrieve an alias line from the file
o Add aliases
o Change the addresses for aliases
o Delete aliases
