@Replace the Darwin-only Alpine-only port with one not based upon, but
designed to match (and eventually replace) the current Pine port.

Missing:
• Support for SUA, BSG, BSM, BSO (i.e., everything other than OXP)
• TCL support for Web Alpine (no TCL on Darwin yet)
• Various other imap/c-client support patches
• ~/.etc support (this will go in later, break compatibility with
  current Alpine ports – which are Darwin only anyway – and restore
  compatibility with Pine ports – as Alpine 1.x = Pine 5.x)
• PGP and S/MIME support
• shared libc-client (required e.g. for PHP)
• …

@Alpine is a fast, easy to use tool for reading, sending, and
managing electronic messages. It was designed specifically with
novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate
the needs of "power users" as well. Alpine uses Internet message
protocols (e.g. RFC-822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, NNTP) and runs on Unix
and PCs. Alpine is based on the Pine Message System, which was
also developed at the University of Washington. Alpine can be
learned by exploration and the use of context-sensitive help. The
user experience is highly customisable through the use of the
Alpine Setup command.

If you want to use the spell checking feature of Alpine, install
ports/textproc/ispell and set the environment variable SPELL to
"${PREFIX}/bin/ispell -l".

The Alpine distribution has been split into subpackages:
* alpine-*: UW Unix Alpine (curses based); user documentation
* alpine-web-*: UW Web Alpine (TCL based)
* c-client-*: UW libc-client; sysop documentation
* imap-uw-*: UW imapd, pop2d, pop3d
* mailutil-uw-*: UW mailutil, dmail, tmail, mlock,
  rpdump, rpload; mbxfix by Andrew Daviel
* pico-*: UW pico (curses text editor)
* pilot-*: UW pilot (curses file manager)

Does not work on MirOS for now.
