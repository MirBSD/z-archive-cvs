1.1
log
@Replace the Darwin-only Alpine-only port with one not based upon, but
designed to match (and eventually replace) the current Pine port.

Missing:
• Support for SUA, BSG, BSM, BSO (i.e., everything other than OXP)
• TCL support for Web Alpine (no TCL on Darwin yet)
• Various other imap/c-client support patches
• ~/.etc support (this will go in later, break compatibility with
  current Alpine ports – which are Darwin only anyway – and restore
  compatibility with Pine ports – as Alpine 1.x = Pine 5.x)
• PGP and S/MIME support
• shared libc-client (required e.g. for PHP)
• …

For imapd-uw:

This port is not safe to use on a system which does not provide shell
access to users who can retrieve mail via IMAP. imapd may contain buffer
overflows which a user can exploit after they have logged into imap to get
access to their account on the machine. If your imap users have shell
access anyway, this is not a significant vulnerability. There is also a
vulnerability wherein local users can prevent arbitrary POP2/3 mailboxes
from being opened, and force IMAP mailboxes to only open read-only.
