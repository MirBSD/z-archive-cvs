@Replace the Darwin-only Alpine-only port with one not based upon, but
designed to match (and eventually replace) the current Pine port.

Missing:
• Support for SUA, BSG, BSM, BSO (i.e., everything other than OXP)
• TCL support for Web Alpine (no TCL on Darwin yet)
• Various other imap/c-client support patches
• ~/.etc support (this will go in later, break compatibility with
  current Alpine ports – which are Darwin only anyway – and restore
  compatibility with Pine ports – as Alpine 1.x = Pine 5.x)
• PGP and S/MIME support
• shared libc-client (required e.g. for PHP)

@Web Alpine is the web-based component of the Alpine Mail System.
It rests on the same distributed email technology behind Alpine,
but is accessible from almost any browser on the World Wide Web.

Web Alpine uses TCL to provide the programmatic interface between
the Alpine-provided message store and the cgi-served web pages.
