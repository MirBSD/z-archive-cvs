log
@Replace the Darwin-only Alpine-only port with one not based upon, but
designed to match (and eventually replace) the current Pine port.

Missing:
• Support for SUA, BSG, BSM, BSO (i.e., everything other than OXP)
• TCL support for Web Alpine (no TCL on Darwin yet)
• Various other imap/c-client support patches
• ~/.etc support (this will go in later, break compatibility with
  current Alpine ports – which are Darwin only anyway – and restore
  compatibility with Pine ports – as Alpine 1.x = Pine 5.x)
• PGP and S/MIME support
• shared libc-client (required e.g. for PHP)

@This is the IMAP4rev1 server utility from the University of
Washington, and two local delivery agents. To use tmail with
sendmail, use
| Mlocal,        P=${PREFIX}/libexec/tmail, F=LlsDFMAw5:/|@@qPrn67E, S=EnvFromL/HdrFromL, R=EnvToL/HdrToL,
|                T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix, E=\r\n,
|                A=tmail $u
and do a chmod 4111 ${PREFIX}/libexec/tmail. The dmail utility can
be used as-is within procmail or local "prog" mailer scripts (see
ports/mail/bmf for an example).

This package also includes a contributed perl script to fix dama-
ged MBX format mailboxes.
