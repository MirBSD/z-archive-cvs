log
@Replace the Darwin-only Alpine-only port with one not based upon, but
designed to match (and eventually replace) the current Pine port.

Missing:
• Support for SUA, BSG, BSM, BSO (i.e., everything other than OXP)
• TCL support for Web Alpine (no TCL on Darwin yet)
• Various other imap/c-client support patches
• ~/.etc support (this will go in later, break compatibility with
  current Alpine ports – which are Darwin only anyway – and restore
  compatibility with Pine ports – as Alpine 1.x = Pine 5.x)
• PGP and S/MIME support
• shared libc-client (required e.g. for PHP)
• …

@The ipop2d, ipop3d, and imapd daemons should be invoked by your
/etc/inetd.conf file with lines such as:

  imap	stream	tcp4	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd 	imapd
  imap	stream	tcp6	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd 	imapd
  pop2	stream	tcp4	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop2d	ipop2d
  pop2	stream	tcp6	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop2d	ipop2d
  pop3	stream	tcp4	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop3d	ipop3d
  pop3	stream	tcp6	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop3d	ipop3d


To use SSL as default transport you need to add the lines below to
/etc/inetd.conf:

  imaps	stream	tcp4	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd 	imapd
  imaps	stream	tcp6	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd 	imapd
  pop3s	stream	tcp4	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop3d	ipop3d
  pop3s	stream	tcp6	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop3d	ipop3d

You also need to install files containing an RSA certificate and
private key to ${SYSCONFDIR}/ssl/ipop3d.pem and
${SYSCONFDIR}/ssl/imapd.pem. See ssl(8) for information on how to
do this.
