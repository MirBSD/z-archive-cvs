@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@KBiff is a "biff" or new mail notification utility. It is highly
configurable but very easy to use and setup. It tries to combine
the best of the features of most of the "other" biff programs out
there.

KBiff supports all major mailbox formats: mbox (Berkeley style),
maildir, mh, POP3, IMAP4, and NNTP.

KBiff is also part of the KDE project. Among other things, this
means that it has support for session management (it "remembers"
the last state it was in before you logged off) and can be docked
into the panel.
