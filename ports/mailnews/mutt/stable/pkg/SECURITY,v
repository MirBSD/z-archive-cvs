Note: in ${WRKDIR}/muttlib.c the function mutt_adv_mktemp
uses mktemp(3), but the resulting name is used much later in
a procedure that does an open with O_CREAT | O_EXCL.  If the
open fails an error is reported and the user can try again.
If the open succeeds the fd is used in fdopen to get a FILE.

This use is actually correct.
