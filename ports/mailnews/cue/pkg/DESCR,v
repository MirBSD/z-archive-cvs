@"Cue" is a small mail user agent (mail reader/writer).

Features:
- capable of handling Japanese and English (or ASCII) emails (no Latin1)
- S/MIME, and MIME Multipart handling
- it looks just like mh-e or mew, but is much more lightweight.  It is not
  an elisp program but an independent program that uses curses.

Cue requires a couple of external programs, namely:
- a program to grab emails into folders, like inc from MH
- a program for sending emails, like sendmail
- an editor like vi
