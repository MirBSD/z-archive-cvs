@spelling cleanup: “programme” is distinct from “program”; even in
British English, the latter is used for computer programs, while
the former serves for things like the TV programme, or a programme

@PGPsendmail is a drop-in wrapper for the standard sendmail
program which resides as /usr/lib/sendmail on most Unix systems.
It allows the automatic encryption of outgoing messages by using the
recipient's PGP public keys. It does *not* provide for automatic
decryption of incoming messages: such a feature would necessarily
involve compromising your passphrase.
However, it can provide for automatic signing of outgoing messages by
using PGPdaemon.
