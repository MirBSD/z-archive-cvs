@TMDA is an OSI certified software application designed to significantly
reduce the amount of SPAM/UCE (junk-mail) you receive. TMDA combines a
"whitelist" (for known/trusted senders), a "blacklist" (for undesired
senders), and a cryptographically enhanced confirmation system (for
unknown, but legitimate senders). TMDA strives to be more effectual, yet
less time-consuming than traditional filters.
