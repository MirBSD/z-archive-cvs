@Initial revision

@ubh - the Usenet Binary Harvester - is a GPL'ed Perl console
application which automatically discovers, downloads, and decodes
single-part and multi-part Usenet binaries.  Automatically assembles
multi-part binaries.  Provides searching via Perl regular expression
syntax.  Also provides a pre-selection capability whereby the user can
interactively choose which binaries to download.  Uses a standard
.newsrc file to control which groups and articles to process.
