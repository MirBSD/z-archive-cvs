@Another perl module, Email::Address. From DESCR:

This class implements a regex-based RFC 2822 parser that locates email
addresses in strings and returns a list of "Email::Address" objects
found. Alternately you may construct objects manually. The goal of this
software is to be correct, and very very fast.
