@many more distfile fixes:
either change stuff to let ‚Äúmmake checksum‚Äù succeed, for example by fixing
MASTER_SITES or DIST_SUBDIR, or by adding the ‚ÄúSize‚Äù That Does Matter‚Ñ¢ to
the distinfo (so that b0rken downloads are skipped), or by whatever other
means, or mark b0rken stuff as BROKEN for sure. For squid, I removed one
of the upstream patches from the list.

After this, all non-BROKEN (and some BROKEN and NOT_FOR_PLATFORM) distfiles
verify successfully (and thusly link to FTP/ and CDROM/ on the mirror).

@by request of bsiegert@@, make all imake-using ports as only for MirOS and
OpenBSD, since they use the -DPorts logic of OpenBSD.cf/MirBSD.cf

since imake.port.mk would be too late, this means touching ‚Äôem all

XXX these openbsd derived ports Makefiles surely look ugly
