@Pan is a newsreader, loosely based on Agent and Gravity, which
attempts to be pleasant to use for new and advanced users alike.
It has all the typical features found in newsreaders and also
supports offline newsreading, sophisticated filtering, multiple
connections, and a number of extra features for power users and
alt.binaries fans.  It's also the only Unix newsreader to get a
perfect score on the Good Net-Keeping Seal of Approval evaluations.
