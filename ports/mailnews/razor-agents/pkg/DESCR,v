@Vipul's Razor is a distributed, collaborative, spam detection and
filtering network. Through user contribution, Razor establishes a
distributed and constantly updating catalogue of spam in propagation
that is consulted by email clients to filter out known spam. Detection
is done with statistical and randomized signatures that efficiently
spot mutating spam content. User input is validated through reputation
assignments based on consensus on report and revoke assertions which
in turn is used for computing confidence values associated with
individual signatures.
