@Sylpheed-claws is the bleeding edge branch of Sylpheed, an e-mail
client and news reader based on GTK+.  Many features are supported
including POP3, IMAP, NNTP, multiple accounts, threading, filtering,
MIME attachments, APOP, SMTP AUTH, SSL, IPv6, GnuPG, internalization,
and more.

Packages can be built with additional FLAVOURs:
    - compface:         use compface (X-Face)
    - gpgme:            enable GnuPG support using GPGME
    - jpilot:           enable JPilot support
    - ldap:             enable LDAP support
    - pixbuf:           enable GDK Pixbuf support
