@wmMultiPop3 is a windowmaker dock app that checks pop3 mail boxes.
It is based on the wmpop3 code, which does not support multiple
boxes.  wmMultiPop3 connects to the pop3 servers that are specified
in the configuration file and will alert you of new mail, and
optionally open your favorite mail reader when middle clicked.

A configuration file (~/.wmmultipop3rc) will be auto-magically
generated upon the first execution of the program.
