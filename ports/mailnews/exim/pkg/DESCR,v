@Exim is a mail transfer agent (MTA) for hosts that are running Unix or
Unix- like operating systems. It was designed on the assumption that it
would be run on hosts that are permanently connected to the Internet.
However, it can be used on intermittently connected hosts with suitable
configuration adjustments.

Starting with exim 4.50, the exiscan patch is included in the default
exim distribution.

This port can be built with the following flavours:

* no_x11	- do not build eximon which requires X11
* no_perl	- do not include perl support
* no_wrap	- do not include TCP/IP wrappers support
* no_ssl	- do not include SSL/TLS support
* mysql		- support mysql queries for lookups
* pgsql		- support postgresql queries for lookups
* ldap		- support ldap (OpenLDAP) queries for lookups
* iconv		- support character code conversions

All these flavours are independent of one another.

@Update exim to 4.50.

The exiscan patch is now integrated. While here, update DESCR a bit and
build some more flavors in bulk builds (not the mysql ones though).
