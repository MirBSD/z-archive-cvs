@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

| Setuid note:
|
| If you intend to use Evolution to read local mail-spool mbox files then
| you will need to set the setuid bit for the camel-lock-helper program.
|
| You can do this by: 'chmod u+s ${PREFIX}/sbin/camel-lock-helper'
|
| While there are no known security problems at this time with
| camel-lock-helper, setting the setuid bit on any program is a
| potential security risk.
