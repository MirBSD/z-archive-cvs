@The "Embedding Perl in HTML with Mason" book documents the HTML::Mason
framework in detail, including chapters on component syntax, Mason
object APIs, a sample site walk-through, recipes, and details on
Mason's advanced features and how to use them.

You can find HTML::Mason in /usr/ports/www/p5-HTML-Mason.
