@This port packages some sample and contributional files that
used to lie within /usr/share/misc/contrib/ until MirOS #7.

In addition to that, here is a central place to get the SSH
public keys and PGP fingerprints of the MirOS developers as
well as the projectâ€™s gzsig(1) keys.

There are several more files, Unicode and keyboard layouts'
tables, conversion tables, vendor branch allotments, etc.
