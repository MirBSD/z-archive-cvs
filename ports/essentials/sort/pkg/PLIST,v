@Add a port for mirsort-20050418.

This package contains the sort(1) utility from the MirOS base system.
It sorts text files by lines.  Comparisons are based on one or more sort
keys extracted from each line of input, and are performed
lexicographically.

This port is necessary because on some systems (notably Darwin), the
standard sort(1) is incompatible with the MirPorts infrastructure, e.g.
when doing recursive builds or recreating the index.
