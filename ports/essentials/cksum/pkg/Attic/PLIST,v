1.3
log
@new cksum mostly due to the manpage change: the manpages used the .Mx macro
which is non-standard _and_ in use by both MirBSD and MidnightBSD

itâ€™s only allowed to use .Mx in a portable MirSubproject if we prepend the
new contrib/samples/portmdoc,v file (which also defines $Mdocdate etc.)

log
@My first Mac OSX port

Shortcoming: no sha512 checksums are generated or checked,
and there is (believe me) no way to get them.
Doesn't matter much though, since we check size+md5+sha1+rmd160
and sha2 is not more secure than sha1 anyway, only longer.
