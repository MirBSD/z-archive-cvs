@LZMA is a general purpose compression algorithm designed by Igor
Pavlov as part of 7-Zip. It provides high compression ratio while
keeping the decompression speed fast.

LZMA 2 is LZMA 1’s successor for what should have been LZMA Utils 5
but became XZ Utils. It’s written by Lasse Collin.

XZ Utils are an attempt to make LZMA compression easy to use on
free (as in freedom) operating systems. This is achieved by providing
tools and libraries which are similar to use than the equivalents
of the most popular existing compression algorithms.
