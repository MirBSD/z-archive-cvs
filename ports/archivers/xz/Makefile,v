# Note on material marked as PD or derived from such in here:

# We got an explicit copyright licence from Igor Pavlov, the

#
# From: Igor Pavlov
# Message-ID: <BFE18C67668F4A56A0965B2115DAB7FA@@igor2>
# Subject: Re: LZMA SDK and legalities of public domain
# […]
# I even don't want to think about these restrictions, countries,
# Berne Convention and so on.
# You can use the code. [in projects under OSS licences that
# include code from LZMA SDK (context: mails from me and Lasse)]
# No restrictions from me.
#
# Further files from Lasse Collin contain these notes as well:
# You can do whatever you want with this file.
# You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into
# the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,
# take the previous sentence as a license grant.
#
# Lasse Collin, around <20111118225931.4b7e60e3@@tukaani.org>, also
# confirms this, adding an interpretation of this as WTFPL and
# explicitly permits sublicencing and to “change the license”; he
# also confirms the authenticity of Igor Pavlov’s answer.

@New port: xz-5.0. From OpenBSD. DESCR:

LZMA is a general purpose compression algorithm designed by Igor
Pavlov as part of 7-Zip. It provides high compression ratio while
keeping the decompression speed fast.

XZ Utils are an attempt to make LZMA compression easy to use on
free (as in freedom) operating systems. This is achieved by providing
tools and libraries which are similar to use than the equivalents
of the most popular existing compression algorithms.
