@New port: xz-5.0. From OpenBSD. DESCR:

LZMA is a general purpose compression algorithm designed by Igor
Pavlov as part of 7-Zip. It provides high compression ratio while
keeping the decompression speed fast.

XZ Utils are an attempt to make LZMA compression easy to use on
free (as in freedom) operating systems. This is achieved by providing
tools and libraries which are similar to use than the equivalents
of the most popular existing compression algorithms.

@welcome the LZMA stand-alone gzip-style archiver to the tree… as I
saw *.tar.lzma files floating around, I asked my favourite source
mage what tool be preferred for operating them, voilà here it is.
