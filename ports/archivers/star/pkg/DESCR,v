@star is the fastest known implementation of a tar archiver. star
development started 1982, development is still in progress. The
current version is stable.

Main advantages over other tar implementations:
    fifo			- Keeps the tape streaming.
    pattern matcher		- For a convenient user interface.
    sophisticated diff		- User-tailorable interface for comparing tar 
				  archives against file trees.
    no namelen limitation	- Pathnames up to 1024 Bytes may be archived.
    deals with all three times	- Stores/restores all three times of a file.
    does not clobber files	- More recent copies on disk will not be 
				  clobbered from tape.
    automatic byte swap		- star automatically detects swapped archives.
    automatic format detect	- Automatically detects archive formats:
				  old tar, GNU tar, ANSI tar, star,
				  POSIX.1-2001 pax, Sun's Solaris tar.
    automatic compression detect- star automatically detects whether the
				  archive is compressed.
    support for file flags	- star supports extended file flags.
    fully ansi compatible	- star is fully ANSI/POSIX 1003.1 compatible.
