@New port: yydecode-0.2.10-0. A decoder for yEnc, a format prevalent in
Usenet newsgroups. From DESCR:

yydecode started life as a decoder for yEnc encoded binaries, which have
recently appeared on Usenet. yydecode works almost identically to the
infamous uudecode program. It also decodes standard uuencoded files, as
well as Base64 [RFC2045] encoded files produced by uuencode.
