@New perl module Compress::Bzip2, an interface to bzip2. That is all there is
to know.
@
text
@The Compress::Bzip2 module provides a Perl interface to the Bzip2
compression library. A relevant subset of the functionality provided by
Bzip2 is available in Compress::Bzip2.

All string parameters can either be a scalar or a scalar reference.

The module can be split into two general areas of functionality, namely
in-memory compression/decompression and read/write access to bzip2
files.
