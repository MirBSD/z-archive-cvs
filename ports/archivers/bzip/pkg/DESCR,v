@Bzip  compresses  files  using the Burrows-Wheeler-Fenwick
block-sorting text compression algorithm.

Compression is generally considerably better than that achieved by
more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and competitive with
all but the best of the PPM family of statistical compressors.

BZIP is distributed under the GNU General Public License version
2; for details, see the file LICENSE. Pointers to the algorithms
used are in ALGORITHMS.

COMMERCIAL USE
==============

This program may or may not infringe certain US patents pertaining
to arithmetic coding and to the block-sorting transformation itself.
Opinions differ as to the precise legal status of some of the
algorithms used. Nevertheless, you should be aware that commercial
use of this program could render you liable to unfriendly legal
action.
