log
@Add a whole bunch of more or less redundant and interdependent
compression, decompression, and archiving modules. You are going to have
all of them for a package that uses the "modbuild" configure style.

@Compress::Raw::Bzip2 provides an interface to the in-memory
compression/uncompression functions from the bzip2 compression library.

Although the primary purpose for the existence of Compress::Raw::Bzip2
is for use by the IO::Compress::Bzip2 and IO::Compress::Bunzip2 modules,
it can be used on its own for simple compression/uncompression tasks.
