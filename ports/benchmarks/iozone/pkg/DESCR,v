@iozone: 'IO Zone' Benchmark Program

iozone tests the speed of sequential I/O to actual files.  Therefore,
this measurement factors in the efficiency of you machines file
system, operating system, C compiler, and C runtime library.  It
produces a measurement which is the number of bytes per second that
your system can read or write to a file.
