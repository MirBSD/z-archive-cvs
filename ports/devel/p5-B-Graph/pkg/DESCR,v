@This module is a layer between the perl-internals-examining parts of
Malcolm Beattie's perl compiler (the B::* classes) and your favorite
graph layout tool (currently Dot and VGC are supported, but adding
others would be easy). It examines the internal structures that perl
builds to represent your code (OPs and SVs), and generates
specifications for multicolored boxes and arrows to represent them.
