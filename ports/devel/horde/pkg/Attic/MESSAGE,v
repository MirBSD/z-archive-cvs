@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@==============================================================
The Horde Application Framework has been installed into
${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../horde ${WWW_PREFIX}/htdocs/horde
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

and proceed to complete the installation by reading:
${INSTDIR}/docs/INSTALL

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<localhost>/horde/test.php

@convert /var/www to ${WWW_PREFIX} more or less mechanically
this breaks some ports, but most of the breakage can be solved
by converting to @@sample and the rest should be some basic
adding of substitution (SUBST_VARS and/or ed/sed)...
