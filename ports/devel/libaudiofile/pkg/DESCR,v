@This Audio File Library is an implementation of the SGI Audio File library.
Since the latter is specified ambiguously in places, I've taken some
liberties in interpreting certain such ambiguities. At the present, not
all features of the SGI Audio File library are implemented. I feel, though,
that this implementation of the Audio File Library offers enough
functionality to be useful for general tasks.

This library allows the processing of audio data to and from audio files of
many common formats (currently AIFF, AIFC, WAVE, and NeXT/Sun).
