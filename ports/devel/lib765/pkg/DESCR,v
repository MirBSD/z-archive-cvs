@lib765 is an emulation of the uPD765a (aka Intel 8272)
Floppy Disc Controller (FDC) as used in Amstrad computers
such as the PCW, CPC and Spectrum +3. At  present it is not
a ``full'' 765; features not used in the PCW BIOS (such as:
DMA, multisector reads/writes, multitrack mode) are either
left unimplemented  or incomplete.
