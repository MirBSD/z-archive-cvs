@CMake is used to control the software compilation process using 
simple platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake 
generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the 
compiler environment of your choice. CMake is quite sophisticated: 
it is possible to support complex environments requiring system 
configuration, pre-processor generation, code generation, and 
template instantiation.
