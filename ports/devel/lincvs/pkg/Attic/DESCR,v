@LinCVS is a QT2-based frontend for the CVS-client supporting
both CVS-versions 1.9 and 1.10, perhaps even older ones....
It allows to check out a module from and import of a module to a
repository, to update or retrieve the status of a working directory
or single files and common operations like add, remove and commit,
diff against the repository or view of the log messages in list
form.
