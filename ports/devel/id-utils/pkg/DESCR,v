@`mkid' is a simple, fast, high-capacity, language-independent
identifier database tool.  Actually, the term `identifier' is too
limiting--`mkid' stores tokens, be they program identifiers of any
form, literal numbers, or words of human-readable text.  Database
queries can be issued from the command-line, or from within emacs,
serving as an augmented tags facility.

`mkid' was originally written by Greg McGary <gkm@@gnu.ai.mit.edu>
and posted to comp.sources.unix in September 1987.  It was then
maintained and enhanced by a loose knit group of programmers on the
Internet led by Tom Horsley <Tom.Horsley@@mail.hcsc.com>.  Tom released
`mkid2' on comp.sources.unix in March, 1991.  Since then, Greg McGary
has resumed maintenance and is releasing an improved version 3 under GPL.

Version 3 is an interim release.  Version 4 will follow in the coming
months and include a cscope clone plus other improvements.
