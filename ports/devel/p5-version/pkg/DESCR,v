1.1
log
@Add a port for the version perl module. From DESCR:

Provides the same version objects as included in Perl v5.9.x (and in the
v5.10.0 release).  In fact, if you attempt to use this module with a
version of Perl >= v5.9.0, this module will not do anything, since the
code already exists in the Perl core.
