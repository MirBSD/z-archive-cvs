@Finally add a port for SVK-2.0.2. I hope I committed all dependencies :).

The port needs a little bit of work but here is something for you to
play with. I will be away until monday.

@SVK is a decentralized version control system.

While Subversion aims to take over the CVS user base, SVK attempts to
take over the others -- including people who are already using other SCM
systems, and people who had not started using SCM.

SVK is written in Perl, using Subversion's underlying filesystem but
provides additional features:

 * Offline operations like "checkin", "log", "merge".
 * Distributed branches.
 * Lightweight checkout copy management (no ".svn" directories).
 * Advanced merge algorithms, like "star-merge" and "cherry picking".
