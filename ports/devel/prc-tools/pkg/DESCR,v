@This is minimal release notes for the utilities that make up the public
release of prc-tools version 0.5.0.  To install code in the Pilot device
from a UNIX box, you will need to get the pilot-link package as well.

You will want to pick up Andrew Howlett's <mailto:howlett@@iosphere.net>
_excellent_ GNU Pilot SDK Tutorial from his site...
