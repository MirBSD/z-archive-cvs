@Add a package for Locale::Maketext::Fuzzy. From DESCR:

This module is a subclass of Locale::Maketext, with additional support
for localizing messages that already contains interpolated variables.

This is most useful when the messages are returned by external sources
-- for example, to match "dir: command not found" against "[_1]: command
not found".
