@update the CVS package in MirPorts (to match base and Debian)

• since the Debian cvs source package was taken over by this one,
  reverse things and use the Debian *.diff.gz to get our patches
  from ;-) saves tracking things in CVS thrice
• since the Debian cvs binary package contains PDF documentation
  generated from something with our patches, ship it instead of
  the one from the vanilla CVS distfile
• ship cvs-switchroot(1) from Debian, which is just a fancy name
  for mircvs://src/scripts/mnt-cvsroot and has a manpage
• move stuff from PREFIX/share/cvs to PREFIX/share/doc/cvs as is proper
• fix regression testsuite on MirBSD as much as possible (same as base)
