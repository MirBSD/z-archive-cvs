@update to latest Debian upload
@
text
@CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep old versions
of files (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why
changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS.  It handles multiple
developers, multiple directories, triggers to enable/log/control
various operations, and can work over a wide area network.  The
following tasks are not included; they can be done in conjunction with
CVS but will tend to require some script-writing and software other
than CVS: bug-tracking, build management (that is, make and make-like
tools), and automated testing.

And a whole lot more.  See the manual for more information.

GNU CVS, with the patches from here applied, is used (in this patched
version) heavily by the MirOS Project, internally, and to maintain the
MirOS BSD, MirPorts Framework, and other subprojects', as well as
hosted projects, such as FWCF, source code and associated other works;
this version also contains many patches originating from Debian and
has now taken over the Debian CVS package, possibly even upstream soon.
