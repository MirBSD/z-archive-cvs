@merge bsiegert@@’s OpenBSD 2.62 port, my MirBSD 2.61 port, add portability
to GNU m4 (back which was removed by these OpenBSD people), fix things,
and add a few workarounds for bugs in our m4 (which increments the line
number too early, upon first encounter of a newline even if the newline
is pushed back into the input buffer)

this is still not ready for general consumption, but good for testing,
and a candidate for AUTOCONF_NEW default *after* the next full MirBSD
release (or, at the very least, full snapshot, which has been adopted);
although I’d rather like to get a 2.65 (but not tonight…) with our m4
working first and switch there then

text
@Autoconf is an extensible package of m4 macros that produce shell
scripts to automatically configure software source code packages.
These scripts alledgedly can adapt the packages to many kinds of
UNIX-like systems without manual user intervention. Autoconf
creates a configuration script for a package from a template file
that lists the operating system features that the package can
use, in the form of m4 macro calls.

This is autoconf-${VSN}.

The actual autoconf drivers for selecting autoconf version are in
the metaauto package.
