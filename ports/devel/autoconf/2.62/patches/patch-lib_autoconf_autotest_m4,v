@merge bsiegert@@’s OpenBSD 2.62 port, my MirBSD 2.61 port, add portability
to GNU m4 (back which was removed by these OpenBSD people), fix things,
and add a few workarounds for bugs in our m4 (which increments the line
number too early, upon first encounter of a newline even if the newline
is pushed back into the input buffer)

this is still not ready for general consumption, but good for testing,
and a candidate for AUTOCONF_NEW default *after* the next full MirBSD
release (or, at the very least, full snapshot, which has been adopted);
although I’d rather like to get a 2.65 (but not tonight…) with our m4
working first and switch there then
