@switch to GNU autoconf 2.60
@
text
@Autoconf is an extensible package of m4 macros that produce shell
scripts to automatically configure software source code packages.
These scripts alledgedly can adapt the packages to many kinds of
UNIX-like systems without manual user intervention. Autoconf
creates a configuration script for a package from a template file
that lists the operating system features that the package can
use, in the form of m4 macro calls.

This is autoconf${SUFX}. 

The actual autoconf drivers for selecting autoconf version are in 
the metaauto package.
