@add a 2.61 port, based upon the 2.60 port but done with more love
this is slowly evolving from a crude “that Other bsd” hack towards
something we can really call a mirport… just read the diffs…

(the doc/Makefile.in diff vs post-install target issue is taste,
not technical – in this case, I only switched to post-install
because the patch threw a reject on one hunk)

@Autoconf is an extensible package of m4 macros that produce shell
scripts to automatically configure software source code packages.
These scripts alledgedly can adapt the packages to many kinds of
UNIX-like systems without manual user intervention. Autoconf
creates a configuration script for a package from a template file
that lists the operating system features that the package can
use, in the form of m4 macro calls.

This is autoconf${SUFFIX}.

The actual autoconf drivers for selecting autoconf version are in
the metaauto package.
