@add a 2.61 port, based upon the 2.60 port but done with more love
this is slowly evolving from a crude “that Other bsd” hack towards
something we can really call a mirport… just read the diffs…

(the doc/Makefile.in diff vs post-install target issue is taste,
not technical – in this case, I only switched to post-install
because the patch threw a reject on one hunk)
