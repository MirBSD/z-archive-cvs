log
@Add a port for Locale::Maketext::Lexicon. From DESCR:

This module provides lexicon-handling backends for "Locale::Maketext" to
read from other localization formats, such as PO files, MO files, or
from databases via the "Tie" interface.

For extracting translatable strings from source files, a "xgettext.pl"
utility is also installed by default.
