@The intent of File::ShareDir is to provide a companion to
Class::Inspector and File::HomeDir, modules that take a process that is
well-known by advanced Perl developers but gets a little tricky, and
make it more available to the larger Perl community.

Quite often you want or need your Perl module (CPAN or otherwise) to
have access to a large amount of read-only data that is stored on the
filesystem at runtime.

On a linux-like system, this would be in a place such as /usr/share,
however Perl runs on a wide variety of different systems, and so the use
of any one location is unreliable. Perl provides a little-known method
for doing this, but almost nobody is aware that it exists.
