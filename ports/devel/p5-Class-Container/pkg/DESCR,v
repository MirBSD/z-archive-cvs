@This class facilitates building frameworks of several classes that
inter-operate. It was first designed and built for "HTML::Mason",
in which the Compiler, Lexer, Interpreter, Resolver, Component,
Buffer, and several other objects must create each other transparently,
passing the appropriate parameters to the right class, possibly
substituting their own subclass for any of these objects.

The main features of "Class::Container" are:
  * Declaration of parameters used by each member in a class framework.
  * Transparent passing of constructor parameters to the class that
    needs them.
  * Ability to create one (automatic) or many (manual) contained
    objects automatically and transparently.
