@add argparse port for Python 2.5
@
text
@The argparse module provides an easy, declarative interface for creating
command line tools, which knows how to:
	parse the arguments and flags from sys.argv
	convert arg strings into objects for your program
	format and print informative help messages
	and much more...

The argparse module improves on the standard library optparse module in a
number of ways including:
	handling positional arguments
	supporting sub-commands
	allowing alternative option prefixes like + and /
	handling zero-or-more and one-or-more style arguments
	producing more informative usage messages
	providing a much simpler interface for custom types and actions

This module became part of the standard library as of Python 2.7.
