@S-Lang is a C programmer's library that includes routines for the rapid
development of sophisticated, user friendly, multi-platform applications.
The S-Lang library includes the following:

- Low level tty input routines for reading single characters at a time.
- Keymap routines for defining keys and manipulating multiple keymaps.
- High level screen management routines for manipulating both
  monochrome and color terminals.  These routines are very efficient.
- Low level terminal-independent routines for manipulating the display
  of a terminal.
- Routines for reading single line input with line editing and recall
  capabilities.
- Searching functions: both ordinary searches and regular expression
  searches.
- An embedded stack-based language interpreter with a C-like syntax.
- A malloc debugging package.
