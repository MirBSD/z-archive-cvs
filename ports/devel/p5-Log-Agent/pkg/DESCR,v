@Initial revision

text
@Log::Agent is a general logging framework aimed at reusable modules.

Instead of having modules insist on using their own logging reporting
(by hardwiring calls to warn() or syslog()) which can conflict with
the final application's choice, one may use logwarn() for instance to
emit a warning.
