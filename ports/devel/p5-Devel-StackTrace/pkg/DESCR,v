@The Devel::StackTrace module contains two classes, Devel::StackTrace
and Devel::StackTraceFrame. The goal of this object is to encapsulate
the information that can found through using the caller() function,
as well as providing a simple interface to this data.

The Devel::StackTrace object contains a set of Devel::StackTraceFrame
objects, one for each level of the stack. The frames contain all
the data available from caller() as of Perl 5.6.0 though this module
still works with 5.00503.
