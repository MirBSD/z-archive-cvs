@LAM (Local Area Multicomputer) is an MPI programming environment and development
system for heterogeneous computers on a network. With LAM, a dedicated cluster 
or an existing network computing infrastructure can act as one parallel computer
solving one problem. 

LAM features extensive debugging support in the application development cycle 
and peak performance for production applications. LAM features a full implemen-
tation of the MPI communication standard (with the exception that canceling sent
messages is not supported).
