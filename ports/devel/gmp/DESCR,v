@GCC still needs GMP and MPFR to build… so update (and regress) GMP
@
text
@GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on
signed integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers. There is
no practical limit to the precision except the ones implied by the
available memory in the machine GMP runs on. GMP has a rich set of
functions, and the functions have a regular interface.

The main target applications for GMP are cryptography applications and
research, Internet security applications, algebra systems, computational
algebra research, etc.

GMP is carefully designed to be as fast as possible, both for small
operands and for huge operands. The speed is achieved by using fullwords
as the basic arithmetic type, by using fast algorithms, with highly
optimised assembly code for the most common inner loops for a lot of
CPUs, and by a general emphasis on speed.

@update gmp, externalise mpfr

sorry if this breaks on the Macintosh, I’ll just fix it there then

GNU MP is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on
signed integers, rational numbers, and floating point numbers.  It has a
rich set of functions, and the functions have a regular interface.

The speed of GNU MP is believed to be faster than any other similar
library. The advantage for GNU MP increases with the operand sizes for
certain operations, since GNU MP in many cases has asymptotically faster
algorithms.

The mpfr library is no longer bundled with gmp, but exists as a separate
package instead.
