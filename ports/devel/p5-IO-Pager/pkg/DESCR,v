log
@Add a port for IO::Pager. From DESCR:

IO::Pager is lightweight and can be used to locate an available pager
and set $ENV{PAGER} sanely or as a factory for creating objects defined
elsewhere such as IO::Pager::Buffered and IO::Pager::Unbuffered.

IO::Pager subclasses are designed to programmatically decide whether or
not to pipe a filehandle's output to a program specified in $ENV{PAGER}.
Subclasses are only required to support filehandle output methods and
close.
