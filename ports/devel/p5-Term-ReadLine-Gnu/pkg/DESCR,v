@Term::ReadLine::Gnu (TRG) is an implementation of the interface to
the GNU Readline Library.  This module gives you input line editing
facility, input history management facility, word completion facility,
etc.  It uses the real GNU Readline Library and has the interface
with the almost all variables and functions which are documented
in the GNU Readline/History Library.  So you can program your custom
editing function, your custom completion function, and so on with
Perl.  TRG may be useful for prototyping before programming with
C.

TRG is upper compatible with Term::ReadLine included in Perl
distribution.  Term::ReadLine uses TRG automatically when TRG is
available.  You can enjoy full line editing feature with Perl
debugger which use Term::ReadLine with no patch.
