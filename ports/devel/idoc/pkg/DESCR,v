@Initial revision

@IDoc extracts interface documentation and declarations from Haskell
modules based on standard Haskell layout rules and a small number of
clues that the programmer may embed in interface comments.  These
clues have been designed to be visually non-imposing when displaying
the source in a text editor.  Interface documentation is rendered in
standard markup languages (currently, only HTML is supported).  IDoc
has been designed to be simple to use and install.
