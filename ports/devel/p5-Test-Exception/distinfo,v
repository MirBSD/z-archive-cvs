@Add a port for Test::Exception. From DESCR:

This module provides a few convenience methods for testing exception
based code. It is built with Test::Builder and plays happily with
Test::More and friends.

Test::Exception only checks for exceptions. It will ignore other
methods of stopping program execution - including exit(). If you have an
exit() in evalled code, Test::Exception will not catch this with any of
its testing functions.
