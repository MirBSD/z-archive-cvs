Since we install GNU make as gmake replace make with gmake in the
manpage where it makes sense.

 .SH DESCRIPTION
 .LP
 The purpose of the
-.I make
+.I gmake
 utility is to determine automatically which
 pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to
 recompile them.
@@@@ -27,17 +27,17 @@@@ The manual describes the GNU implementat
 which was written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is
 currently maintained by Paul Smith.
 Our examples show C programs, since they are most common, but you can use
-.I make
+.I gmake
 with any programming language whose compiler can be run with a
 shell command.
 In fact,
-.I make
+.I gmake
 is not limited to programs.
 You can use it to describe any task where some files must be
 updated automatically from others whenever the others change.
 .LP
 To prepare to use
-.IR make ,
+.IR gmake ,
 you must write a file called the
 .I makefile
 that describes the relationships among files in your program, and the
@@@@ -49,17 +49,17 @@@@ Once a suitable makefile exists, each ti
 this simple shell command:
 .sp 1
 .RS
-.B make
+.B gmake
 .RE
 .sp 1
 suffices to perform all necessary recompilations.
 The
-.I make
+.I gmake
 program uses the makefile data base and the last-modification times
 of the files to decide which of the files need to be updated.
 For each of those files, it issues the commands recorded in the data base.
 .LP
-.I make
+.I gmake
 executes commands in the

 If no

 that have been modified since the target was last modified,
 or if the target does not exist.

 Print debugging information in addition to normal processing.
@@@@ -134,7 +134,7 @@@@ The debugging information says which fil

 which files actually need to be remade, which implicit rules are
 considered and which are applied---everything interesting about how

 decides what to do.

@@@@ -181,7 +181,7 @@@@ If several
 options are used to specify several directories, the directories are
 searched in the order specified.
 Unlike the arguments to other flags of

 flags may come directly after the flag:

 This is never necessary except in a recursive
-.I make
+.I gmake
 where
 .B \-k
 might be inherited from the top-level
-.I make

 via MAKEFLAGS or if you set
 .B \-k
 in MAKEFLAGS in your environment.
@@@@ -280,11 +280,11 @@@@ Touch files (mark them up to date withou

 This is used to pretend that the commands were done, in order to fool
 future invocations of
-.IR make .

 .TP 0.5i
 .BR \-v , " \-\-version"
 Print the version of the
-.I make

 program plus a copyright, a list of authors and a notice that there
 is no warranty.
