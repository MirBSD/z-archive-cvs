log
@change this ${PKGNAME}
from pkgconfig-bsd-20070223-0
to   pkgconfig-20070223-0-bsd
(i.e. make the difference a flavour), because
• pkgconfig-bsd had a @@pkgcfl in its PLIST, but pkgconfig didn't, so you
  could install pkgconfig-bsd first then pkgconfig and *boom* (@@pkgcfl is
  not the right thing for this anyway, because you can't introduce them
  later into packages made before)
• ghostscript (artifex vs esp) now uses flavours, too
• the pkgconfig module can now build-depend on something like
  pkgconfig->=0.15.0-2|pkgconfig->=200xyyzz,bsd
  (bsiegert@@ must of course make this work in pkg_info -e &c.)

Hand-edited PLIST, not tested this port at all, dunno if it has support
for the URL keyword from new curl package either…

@Add a port for OpenBSD's perl clone of pkg-config. I am going to build some
packages with it to see how it does.
