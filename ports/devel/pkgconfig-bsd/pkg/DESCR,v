1.1
log
@Add a port for OpenBSD's perl clone of pkg-config. I am going to build some
packages with it to see how it does.
@
text
@The pkg-config utility retrieves metadata about the installation of
software packages. This metadata includes version, compiler and linker
flags, and dependency information.
It is inspired by, and intended to operate as a drop-in replacement to,
the program of the same name available from freedesktop.org.
