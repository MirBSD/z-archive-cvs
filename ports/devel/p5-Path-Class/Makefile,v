@Add a port for Path::Class. From DESCR:

Path::Class is a module for manipulation of file and directory
specifications (strings describing their locations, like
'/home/ken/foo.txt' or 'C:\Windows\Foo.txt') in a cross-platform manner.
It supports pretty much every platform Perl runs on, including Unix,
Windows, Mac, VMS, Epoc, Cygwin, OS/2, and NetWare.

The well-known module File::Spec also provides this service, but it's
sort of awkward to use well, so people sometimes avoid it, or use it in
a way that won't actually work properly on platforms significantly
different than the ones they've tested their code on.

In fact, Path::Class uses File::Spec internally, wrapping all the
unsightly details so you can concentrate on your application code.
Whereas File::Spec provides functions for some common path
manipulations, Path::Class provides an object-oriented model of the
world of path specifications and their underlying semantics.
