@GNU libavl, a library for balanced binary trees. Balanced binary trees
provide guaranteed O(lg n) performance for list insertion, deletion, and
search operations. libavl is the most complete free balanced binary tree
library on the net today, supporting AVL trees in plain, threaded, and
right-threaded forms as well as plain red-black trees.
