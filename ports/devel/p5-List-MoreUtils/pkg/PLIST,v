@Add a port for List::MoreUtils. From DESCR:

List::MoreUtils provides some trivial but commonly needed functionality
on lists which is not going to go into List::Util.

All of the below functions are implementable in only a couple of lines
of Perl code. Using the functions from this module however should give
slightly better performance as everything is implemented in C. The
pure-Perl implementation of these functions only serves as a fallback in
case the C portions of this module couldn't be compiled on this machine.
