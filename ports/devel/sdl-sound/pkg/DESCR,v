@SDL_sound is a library that handles the decoding of several popular
sound file formats, such as .WAV and .MP3.  It is meant to make the
programmer's sound playback tasks simpler.  The programmer gives
SDL_sound a filename, or feeds it data directly from one of many
sources, and then reads the decoded waveform data back at their leisure.
If resource constraints are a concern, SDL_sound can process sound data
in programmer-specified blocks.  Alternately, SDL_sound can decode a
whole sound file and hand back a single pointer to the whole waveform.
SDL_sound can also handle sample rate, audio format, and channel
conversion on-the-fly and behind-the-scenes, if the programmer desires.
