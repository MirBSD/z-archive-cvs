1.1
log
@Add a port for List::Util and Scalar::Util. Both are contained in our perl
in base but have a memory leak (and svk needs a newer version).

Patch installers so that installation proceeds into the usual place, not
/usr/libdata/perl5.
@
text
@This package contains a selection of subroutines that people have
expressed would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not
really be high enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size so
small such that being individual extensions would be wasteful.
