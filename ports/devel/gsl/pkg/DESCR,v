@This is GSL, the GNU Scientific Library.

It is still in early stages of development, but it is being placed on
ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/ in hopes that others might be interested in
joining the project.

The random, fft, siman, roots, statistics and specfunc are reasonable
well developed.  All but the later are documented in gsl-ref.texi.

A test suite is available for most of the libraries.  It can be
invoked with "make check" in each directory.  All tests can be run
together with "make check" at the top level.

If you are interested in participating in GSL development, please send
mail to Mark Galassi -- rosalia@@cygnus.com
