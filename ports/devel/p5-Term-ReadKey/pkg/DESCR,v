@Initial revision

@This module, ReadKey, provides ioctl control for terminals and Win32
consoles so the input modes can be changed (thus allowing reads of
a single character at a time), and also provides non-blocking reads
of stdin, as well as several other terminal related features,
including retrieval/modification of the screen size, and
retrieval/modification of the control characters.
