@GNU libtool is a generic library support script. Libtool hides
the complexity of using shared libraries behind a consistent,
portable interface.

To use libtool, add the new generic library building commands to
your Makefile, Makefile.in, or Makefile.am. See the documentation
for details.

This version already contains the patches needed for supporting
Darwin / Mac OSX (upstream), MidnightBSD, MirOS, OpenBSD, and
Interix / Microsoft Services for Unix(R) under the MirPorts
Framework or standalone.
