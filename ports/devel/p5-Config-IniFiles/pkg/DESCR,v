@Config::IniFiles provides a way to have readable configuration files
outside your Perl script. The configuration can be safely reloaded upon
receipt of a signal. Configurations can be imported (inherited,
stacked,...), sections can be grouped, and settings can be accessed from
a tied hash.

Ini files consist of a number of sections, each preceeded with the
section name in square brackets. Parameters are specified in each section
as Name=Value. Any spaces around the equals sign will be ignored, and the
value extends to the end of the line.
