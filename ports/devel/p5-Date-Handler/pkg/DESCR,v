@Date::Handler is a container for dates that holds all the methods
to transform itself from Timezone to Timezone and format itself.
This module idea comes from an original version written by dLux
(Szabo, Balazs) <dlux@@kapu.hu> in his module Class::Date.

Date::Handler is implemented in pure Perl using POSIX modules, it
encapsulates the environment variable TZ for it's time zone management
so you don't have to play with it externally in the implementation.

It uses operator overloading and Delta date objects to calculates
time differences.
