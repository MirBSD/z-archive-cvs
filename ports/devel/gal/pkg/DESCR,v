@Initial revision

@This module contains some library functions that came from Gnumeric
and Evolution.  The idea is to reuse the code across various larger
GNOME applications that might want to use it.  The API is not frozen
and might change at any time.  Larger class renaming might happen
at any point without notice.  Use this library at your own risk.
