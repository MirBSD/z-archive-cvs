@Hmake is an intelligent compilation management tool for Haskell
programs. It automatically extracts dependencies between source
modules, and issues the appropriate compiler commands to rebuild
only those that have changed, given just the name of the program
or module that you want to build.

Hmake interactive, or hi for short, is an interpreter-like
environment that you can wrap over any common Haskell compiler to
achieve an interactive development style. It deliberately looks
and feels a lot like the Hugs interpreter. The difference is that
you get real compiled code, compiled by your favorite compiler -
you can even change compiler on the fly, to check your code's
portability!
