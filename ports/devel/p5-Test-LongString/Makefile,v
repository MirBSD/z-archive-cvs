@New package Test::LongString. All those perl packages are dependencies of
RequestTracker btw. From DESCR:

This module provides some drop-in replacements for the string comparison
functions of Test::More, but which are more suitable when you test
against long strings. If you've ever had to search for text in a
multi-line string like an HTML document, or find specific items in
binary data, this is the module for you.
