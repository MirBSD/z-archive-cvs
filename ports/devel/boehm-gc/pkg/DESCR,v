@Update the Boehm Garbage Collector to version 6.8. Works for me on
MirOS-current (regression test and w3m tested). Patches from the old port
are simply adapted.

patch-include_private_gcconfig_h is VERY IMPORTANT, boehm-gc does not work
when this file is not correctly patched.

@The Boehm-Weiser garbage collection package, for C and C++ - garbage
collection and memory leak detection libraries.

A garbage collector is something which automatically frees malloc'd
memory for you by working out what parts of memory your program
no longer has pointers to. As a result, garbage collectors can also
inform you of memory leaks (if they find memory they can free, it means
you have lost all of your pointers to it, but you didn't free it).

C programs should run without change. C++ programs must include a header
to use garbage collection. See the man page and header files.

This port is really a buggy mess; don't be surprised if it doesn't
run correctly. The Boehm-Weiser garbage collection package, for C
