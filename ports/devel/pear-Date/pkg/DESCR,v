@Generic classes for representation and manipulation of
dates, times and time zones without the need of timestamps, which
is a huge limitation for php programs. Includes time zone data,
time zone conversions and many date/time conversions.  It does not
rely on 32-bit system date stamps, so you can display calendars
and compare dates that date pre 1970 and post 2038. This package
also provides a class to convert date strings between Gregorian
and Human calendar formats.
