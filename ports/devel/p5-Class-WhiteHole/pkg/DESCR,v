@Its possible to accidentally inherit an AUTOLOAD method.  Often this
will happen if a class somewhere in the chain uses AutoLoader or defines
one of their own.  This can lead to confusing error messages when method
lookups fail.

Sometimes you want to avoid this accidental inheritance.  In that case,
inherit from Class::WhiteHole.  All unhandled methods will produce
normal Perl error messages.
