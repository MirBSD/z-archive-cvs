@Automake is an experimental Makefile generator.  It was inspired by
the 4.4BSD make and include files, but aims to be portable and to
conform to the GNU standards for Makefile variables and targets.

Automake assumes the project uses autoconf.  If you want automatic
dependency tracking support, the use of GNU make is also required.
