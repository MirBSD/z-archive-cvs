log
@Add a port for Test::Manifest. From DESCR:

Test::Manifest overrides the default behaviour by replacing the
test_via_harness target in the Makefile. Instead of running at the t/*.t
files in ascii-betical order, it looks in the t/test_manifest file to
find out which tests you want to run and the order in which you want to
run them. It constructs the right value for MakeMaker to do the right
thing.
