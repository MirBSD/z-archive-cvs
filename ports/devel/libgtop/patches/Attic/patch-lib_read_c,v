1.2
log
@Update to 2.14.6, the exact same version as in OpenBSD ports. It was from
there that I took the patches, except that they didn't work. So it was
still not trivial.

This port is a nightmare. It is full of system dependencies. Just one look
at the patch filenames should tell you enough. It actually defines _KERNEL
in some places to get things like struct msginfo. Its server is sgid kmem.
