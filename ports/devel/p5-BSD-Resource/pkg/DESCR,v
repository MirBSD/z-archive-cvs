@This Perl extension implements the BSD process resource limit functions

        getrusage()     getrlimit()     setrlimit()

and the BSD process priority functions.  These are available also via
core Perl but here there are more tricks so that the PRIO_* are 
available.

        getpriority()   setpriority()

Also is provided

        times() -- which provides the same functionality as the one in
                   core Perl, only with better time resolution.

        get_rlimits() -- a pure perl function with no BSD analog to
                         find which limits are available
