@SMPEG is a free mpeg1 video player library with sound
support.  Video playback is based on the ubiquitous Berkeley
mpeg player, mpeg_play v2.2.  SMPEG supports mpeg audio
(mp3), based on mpg123's source, mpeg-1 video, and mpeg
system streams.

plaympeg and gtv are simple video players provided to test
the library.

This is a work in progress. Only 16 bit colour depth is
supported.  The player will dynamically conver to other
colour depths, but playback will be much faster if your
display is already set to 16 bit colour depth.
