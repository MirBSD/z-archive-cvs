@make this pass all (even the C++) tests
ironically, the testsuite itself was b0rken too, although
a C++ compiler might have let that passâ€¦

@"Bison" is a general-purpose parser generator that converts a grammar
description for an LALR(1) context-free grammar into a C program
to parse that grammar.  Once you are proficient with Bison, you may
use it to develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used
in simple desk calculators to complex programming languages.

Bison is upward compatible with Yacc: all properly-written Yacc
grammars ought to work with Bison with no change.  Anyone familiar
with Yacc should be able to use Bison with little trouble.  You
need to be fluent in C programming in order to use Bison.
