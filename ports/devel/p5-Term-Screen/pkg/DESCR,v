@Term::Screen is a very simple screen positioning module
that should work wherever "Term::Cap" does. It is set up
for Unix using stty's but these dependences are isolated
by evals in the "new" constructor. Thus you may create a
child module implementing Screen with MS-DOS, ioctl, or
other means to get raw and unblocked input.
