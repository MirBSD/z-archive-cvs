@The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by appli-
cations that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in.
Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The Readline library
includes additional functions to maintain a list of previously-entered
command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform
csh-like history expansion on previous commands.

The history facilites are also placed into a separate library, the
History library, as part of the build process. The History library may
be used without Readline in applications which desire its capabilities.
