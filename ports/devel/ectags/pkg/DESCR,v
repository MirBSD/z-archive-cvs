@Exuberant Ctags is a multilanguage reimplementation of the much-
underused ctags(1) program. It generates indexes of source code
definitions which are used by a number of editors and tools.

Support for Assembler, AWK, ASP, BETA, Bourne/Korn/Z Shell, C,
C++, COBOL, Eiffel, Fortran, Java, Lisp, Makefile, Pascal, Perl,
PHP, Python, REXX, Ruby, S-Lang, Scheme, Tcl, and Vim is present;
in particular, the C/C++ parser is far less easily fooled by pre-
processor conditional constructs than many other ctags(1) imple-
mentations.
