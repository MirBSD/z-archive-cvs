@libio provides an abstraction for general data transport. It creates
data sources and data sinks. The sources and sinks can be connected with
multiple filters. As a result encryption and authentication can happen
completely transparent to the main core of an application. Mutliplex
nodes can be used to deal with N-fan in and M-fan out.
