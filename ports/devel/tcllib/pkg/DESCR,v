@This is the core development home for the tcllib standardized Tcl
library. This is a set of pure-Tcl extensions that you can use to
become even more productive with Tcl.

Among the libraries in this package are routines to do base64 operations,
CRC and DES, HTML and Javascript manipulation, NTP, POP and NNTP protocols,
and profile Tcl code.
