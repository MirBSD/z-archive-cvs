@Algorithm::Diff is a perl module that provides an interface to compute
the difference between two files, two strings, or any other two lists
of things.  It uses an intelligent algorithm similar/identical to the
one used by classical Unix diff(1).  It is guaranteed to find the
*smallest possible* set of differences.
