1.1
log
@Add patches for apr and apr-util 0.9. Starting with subversion 1.4.0, these
are no longer contained in the subversion tarball. We will use the upstream
versions with some bugfixes.

While adding the conflict to subversion-<1.4.0, I triggered a bug in
pkgtools, which is fixed now.

All of this was tested only on Mac OS X but as subversion already ran on
MirOS with these patches, there should be no problem.
