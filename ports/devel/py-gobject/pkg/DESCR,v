1.1
log
@Add a port for py-gobject-2.12.3-0, now a dependency of the new py-gtk
(which has not yet been updated).

From DESCR:

This package contains Python bindings for GObject.  It is a fairly
complete set of bindings, it's already rather useful, and is usable to
write moderately complex programs (see the examples directory for some
examples of the simpler programs you could write).
