@Add a port for Data::ICal, has lots of dependencies. From DESCR:

A Data::ICal object represents a "VCALENDAR" object as defined in the
iCalendar protocol (RFC 2445, MIME type "text/calendar"), as implemented
in many popular calendaring programs such as Apple's iCal.

Each Data::ICal object is a collection of "entries", which are objects
of a subclass of Data::ICal::Entry. The types of entries defined by
iCalendar (which refers to them as "components") include events, to-do
items, journal entries, free/busy time indicators, and time zone
descriptors; in addition, events and to-do items can contain alarm
entries. (Currently, Data::ICal only implements to-do items and events.)

Data::ICal is a subclass of Data::ICal::Entry; see its manpage for more
methods applicable to Data::ICal.
