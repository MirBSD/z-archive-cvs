@LyX is a wordprocessor frontend to LaTeX, which gives both the
ease-of-use of a wordprocessor, and the flexibility and power
of LaTeX.

LyX produces high quality, professional output -- using LaTeX, an
industrial strength typesetting engine, in the background; LyX is
far more than a front-end to LaTeX, however. No knowledge of LaTeX
is necessary to use LyX, although it will give a user more power.

LyX is stable and fully featured. It has been used for documents 
as large as a thesis, or as small as a business letter. 
Despite its simple GUI interface (available in many languages), 
it suports tables, figures, and hyperlinked cross-references, and
best-of-breed math editor.

Flavours:
	qt 	- build with a Qt GUI (open-source GPL library)
	xforms 	- build with an XForms GUI (closed-source library)
