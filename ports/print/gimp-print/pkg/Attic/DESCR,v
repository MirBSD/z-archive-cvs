@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@Gimp-Print is a package of high quality printer drivers for Linux, BSD,
Solaris, IRIX, and other UNIX-alike operating systems. In many cases,
these drivers rival or exceed the OEM drivers in quality and functiona-
lity. Our goal is to produce the highest possible output quality from all
supported printers. To that end, we have done extensive work on screening
algorithms, color generation, and printer feature utilization. We are
continuing our work in all of these areas to produce ever higher quality
results, particularly on the ubiquitous, inexpensive inkjet printers that
are nonetheless capable of nearly photographic output quality.

Despite the name, printing support for The GIMP is only one small part of
what Gimp-Print does, and indeed, the Print plugin may eventually be
removed from the core Gimp-Print distribution. Gimp-Print printer drivers
can be used with all common UNIX print spooling systems, by means of
either CUPS or Ghostscript.

Here is a list of selected features:
* Support for almost 300 printers made by Canon, Epson, Hewlett-Packard,
  Lexmark, and true compatibles.
* The Print plug-in for the GIMP.
* A native CUPS driver, providing simple configuration and operation with
  CUPS.
* A native Ghostscript driver that can be compiled into Ghostscript.
* A new, IJS-based Ghostscript driver that greatly simplifies
  installation for Ghostscript versions 6.53 and newer.
* Complete Foomatic support for simplified configuration with all common
  printing systems.
* Extensive output adjustments offer a tremendous range of adjustment to
  match color, brightness, and contrast.
* Support for a wide range of printer output resolutions, permitting you
  to trade off printing speed against output quality.
* 16-bit precision, producing virtually stepless output.
* Bundled utilities to perform basic maintenance for Epson and Lexmark
  printers.
* Extensive documentation for both users and developers.
