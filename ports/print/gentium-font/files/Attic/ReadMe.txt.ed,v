Specifically the font files, but the read me should always be included (feel
free to rewrap).

The software of the font cannot be copied. In other words, you can't pull
the font into FontLab or Fontforge, play with it, rename it and
redistribute. There is no problem with using the fonts to create graphic
images - as long as they're not fonts themselves. You can certainly publish
a book using Gentium.

We're working hard on getting approval to move to a much more open license.
I can't give you any idea of when that may happen, though. But I think
you'll like what we have in mind.
