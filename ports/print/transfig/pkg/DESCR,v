@TransFig is a set of tools for creating TeX documents with graphics
which are portable, in the sense that they can be printed in a wide
variety of environments.  This is version 3.1.2.

Drivers currently exist for the following graphics languages: (E)EPIC
macros, LaTeX picture environment, PIC, PiCTeX, PostScript, and
TeXtyl.  Fig2dev can be configured with a subset of these drivers
