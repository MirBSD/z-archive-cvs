1.2
log
@Modernize, unbreak, etc.

- use MirLibtool, not ltconfig (no kidding!)
- update build system from autoconf 2.14a, which does not actually exist,
  to $latest
- use aclocal instead of "cat *m4 > aclocal.m4"
- custom autogen.sh for automake --add-missing, autoconf in ogonkify subdir
- some preprocessor symbols changed names
- don't use the automake macros delivered in ~15 .m4 files here, use v1.9.6
- libtoolize plist
- use @@sample, get rid of INSTALL and DEINSTALL

Getting the configure right took me all afternoon. Not everything is ok now
but it builds and works.
