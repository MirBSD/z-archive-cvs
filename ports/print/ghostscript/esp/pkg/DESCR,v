@ESP Ghostscript is a PostScript interpreter. It is a derivative of GPL
Ghostscript and contains bug-fixes, an improved build system, CUPS
support and other new stuff.

Flavours:

no_x11		Don't build X11 support
cups		Add CUPS pstoraster driver, needed to print on non-
		PostScript printers (replaces cups-pstoraster)
