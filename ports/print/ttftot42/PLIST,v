*cough*

From DESCR:
TrueType fonts cannot be converted to Type 1 fonts without loss of
quality, since conversion introduces rounding errors and loses hinting
information.  Therefore, newer PostScript interpreters (Adobe PostScript
since version 2013, ghostscript since 5.03) include a TrueType
rasterizers.  To use a TrueType font with them, it has to be embedded in
a PostScript font dictionary; this format is called Type 42.

This program generates such Type 42 fonts from TrueType fonts.  It can
also generate Adobe Font Metrics files (AFM files), including kerning
information.

Not yet supported are TrueType Collections and the creation of CID keyed
fonts from large TrueType fonts (East Asian or Unicode fonts).
