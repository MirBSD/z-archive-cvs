@Initial revision

@L2A is a filter to ``detexify'' texts.  That is, it attempts to remove
LaTeX markup commands, leaving only the body of text.  It is intended to
be used when journal editors request plain ASCII text for typesetting, or
when you want to post a plain version of a LaTeX document on an electronic
conference system.
