@Big round of bugfixes for cups. This time, cups and related apps (such as
ESP Ghostscript) should actually work ...

 - Thanks to tg@@ for the php detection bug.
 - Don't emit -Wl,-soname,libcups.la so linking to the libraries works
   again.
 - Fix the case where SYSCONFDIR != /etc (my bad, actually).
 - Fix a syntax error in the cups-config script.
 - Fix a typo in DESCR while here.
 - Bump patchlevel.

Hint: You MUST rebuild print/ghostscript/esp after upgrading (if you use
it, that is).

@CUPS provides a portable printing layer for UNIX(r)-based
operating systems.  CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley
command-line interfaces.

CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") as the basis
for managing print jobs and queues.  The Line Printer Daemon
("LPD"), Server Message Block ("SMB"), and AppSocket (a.k.a.
JetDirect) protocols are also supported with reduced
functionality.  CUPS adds network printer browsing and
PostScript Printer Description ("PPD") based printing options to
support real-world printing under UNIX.
