1.2
log
@This was broken on MirOS-current as it uses unsupported behavior: it
compiles libcupsimage agains libjpg and libpng and then "forgets" to link
them into the executables. This triggers a linker bug in my snapshot and
causes a segfault in ld.

There is some unsupported libtool stuff in the cups Makefiles. Bring it up
to shape and unconditionally use it (MirLibtool) for the build. Works for
me.

Also remove INSTALL/DEINSTALL and replace it by @@sample. Bump patchlevel.
