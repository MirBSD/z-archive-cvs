@dvi2tty is intended for previewing dvi-files on text-only devices
(terminals and lineprinters). A number of switches exist to control the 
format of the output, including width of the lines and even some
limited font handling. The program is basicly an improved C version
of the pascal program written by Svante Lindahl (see README.ORG).

Disdvi is a simple hack that dumps a dvi file in a more readable form.
