log
@New port ttf-anonymous-pro. From DESCR:

Anonymous Pro is a family of four fixed-width fonts designed especially
with coding in mind. Characters that could be mistaken for one another
(O, 0, I, l, 1, etc.) have distinct shapes to make them easier to tell
apart in the context of source code.

Anonymous Pro also features an international, Unicode-based character
set, with support for most Western and European Latin-based languages,
Greek, and Cyrillic. It includes special "box drawing" characters for
those who need them. It also includes embedded bitmaps for specific
pixel sizes (10, 11, 12, 13).
