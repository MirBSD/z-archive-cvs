@Before Motif came along, OPEN LOOK was the standard look and feel for X,
for a thousand generations of... Sorry, wrong plot. For a long time.
XView was the standard library, and TextEdit the standard Text Editor.
Here is an OpenBSD port of TextEdit based upon Sun's open source distribution
of The XView Toolkit. For more information on OPEN LOOK, refer to the
OPEN LOOK CD-ROM, at http://www.darwinsys.com/olcd.
