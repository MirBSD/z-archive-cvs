@GNU nano is a free replacement for Pico, the default Pine editor.
GNU nano is an effort to provide a Pico-like editor, but also
includes some features that were missing in the original, such as
'search and replace', 'goto line' or internationalisation support.

nano is a small, free and friendly editor which aims to replace
Pico, the default editor included in the non-free Pine package.
Rather than just copying Pico's look and feel, nano also implements
some missing (or disabled by default) features in Pico, such as
"search and replace" and "goto line number".

Available flavours:
	slang - build using the S-Lang library for screen handling
