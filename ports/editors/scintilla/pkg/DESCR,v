@Scintilla is a free source code editing component. As well as features
found in standard text editing components, Scintilla includes features
especially useful when editing and debugging source code. These include
support for syntax styling, error indicators, code completion and call
tips. The selection margin can contain markers like those used in debuggers
to indicate breakpoints and the current line. Styling choices are more open
than with many editors, allowing the use of proportional fonts, bold and
italics, multiple foreground and background colours and multiple fonts.
