| XEmacs is pretty useless as-is.  It is just an engine.
| You need to install modules to provide your users full functionnality.
| There is two methods to achieve this :
| 1 - install the xemacs21-sumo package.  It contains all the 
|     modules currently supported by the XEmacs team.
|     It's fast, easy and your users won't ever bother you again about this.
|     On the other hand the package is quite huge.
| 2 - you have to install by hand every XEmacs' modules as described
|     in the XEmacs documentation. (Search for "packages" in the info tree.)
|     There are a lot of interdependencies between XEmacs' modules
|     and you may end up with everything installed just as method 1 would
|     have (without the hassle).
|
| Note: XEmacs modules are named "packages" by the XEmacs team, the term
|	"module" is used here just to limit possible confusion with
|	OpenBSD packages.
