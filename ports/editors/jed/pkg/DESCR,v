@JED is a highly customizable text editor offering most of the
commonly used features of EMACS without the proportions of EMACS.  The default
configuration uses EMACS keystrokes, though WordStar keystrokes are
available, and most any keystrokes can be programmed.n  JED is customizable 
and programmable in the language SLANG, which can look like forth or c, 
depending on your preferences.
