@Text::Autoformat provides intelligent formatting of plaintext. It also
supplies a replacement for the built-in perl format()'ing mechanism. It
recognizes Internet quoting conventions, bulleting and numbering, and
allows for inter-word and inter-paragraph spatial adjustments, text
justification, and various capitalization schemes.
