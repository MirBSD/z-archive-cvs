@Hevea is yet another latex to html translator, written in Ocaml.
It is more sturdy and yields generally better results than latex2html.

Optionally, Hevea may be instructed not to process part of the input,
but to use the imagen script to create a .gif image and link to that file.

The imagen script needs LaTeX, dvips, ghostscript and tools from netpbm.

Thus, Hevea does not require tetex, ghostscript, nor netpbm, but its
full functionality can only be achieved if you install those packages.

By default, hevea creates documents using the <FONT FACE=symbol> facility
of html, which may require special configuration of your browser.
For Netscape, add 

! Repair symbol font for hevea
Netscape*documentFonts.charset*adobe-fontspecific: iso-8859-1

to your .Xresource

Alternately, you may use hevea -nosymb to turn that off.

See section C.2 of the documentation for more details.
