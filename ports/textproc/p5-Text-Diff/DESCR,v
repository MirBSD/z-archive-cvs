log
@New perl module Text::Diff. From DESCR:

diff() provides a basic set of services akin to the GNU diff utility. It
is not anywhere near as feature complete as GNU diff, but it is better
integrated with Perl and available on all platforms. It is often faster
than shelling out to a system's diff executable for small files, and
generally slower on larger files.

This package also contains Text::Diff::Table, a plugin output formatter
for Text::Diff that generates "table" style diffs.
