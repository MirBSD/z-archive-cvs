@Jade is James Clark's implementation of DSSSL -- Document Style
Semantics and Specification Language -- an ISO standard for formatting
SGML (and XML) documents.

OpenJade is a project undertaken by the DSSSL community to maintain
and extend Jade. OpenJade is distributed under the same license as
Jade.

OpenJade is a command line application and a set of components. The
DSSSL engine receives as input an SGML or XML document and transforms
it into formats like:

* XML representation of the flow object tree. 
* RTF format that can be rendered and printed with Microsoft's free
  Word Viewer 97   
* TeX format 
* MIF format that can be rendered and printed with Framemaker 
* SGML or XML format. This is used in conjunction with non-standard
  flow object classes to generate SGML, thus allowing OpenJade to be
  used for SGML/XML transformations.
