@Ispell is a fast screen-oriented spelling checker that shows you your
errors in the context of the original file, and suggests possible
corrections when it can figure them out.  Compared to UNIX spell, it is
faster and much easier to use.

This package adds a German dictionary that can be used by ispell.
