log
@New package CSS::Squish. From DESCR:

This module takes a list of CSS files and concatenates them, making sure
to honor any valid @@import statements included in the files.

Following the CSS 2.1 spec, @@import statements must be the first rules
in a CSS file. Media-specific @@import statements will be honored by
enclosing the included file in an @@media rule. This has the side effect
of actually improving compatibility in Internet Explorer, which ignores
media-specific @@import rules but understands @@media rules.
