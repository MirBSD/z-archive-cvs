log
@Initial revision

@wdiff  compares  two  files, finding which words have been
deleted or added to old_file to get new_file.  A  word  is
anything  between whitespace.  The output is collected and
used to produce an annotated copy of new_file on  standard
output.  Suitable  annotations  produce  a nice display of
word differences between the original files.
