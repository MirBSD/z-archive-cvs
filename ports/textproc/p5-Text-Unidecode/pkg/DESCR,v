@Initial revision

@Text::Unidecode provides is a function, `unidecode(...)' that takes
Unicode data and tries to represent it in US-ASCII characters 
(i.e., the universally displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F).
The representation is almost always an attempt at *transliteration*
-- i.e., conveying, in Roman letters, the pronunciation expressed by 
the text in some other writing system.
