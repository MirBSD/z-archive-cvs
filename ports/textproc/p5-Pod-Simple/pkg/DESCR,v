@Pod::Simple is a Perl library for parsing text in the Pod ("plain
old documentation") markup language that is typically used for
writing documentation for Perl and for Perl modules. The Pod format
is explained in the perlpod man page; the most common formatter is
called "perldoc".

Pod formatters can use Pod::Simple to parse Pod documents into
produce renderings of them in plain ASCII, in HTML, or in any number
of other formats. Typically, such formatters will be subclasses of
Pod::Simple, and so they will inherit its methods, like parse_file.
