@Update to 1.41. From the new DESCR:

This module provides a basic framework for creating and maintaining RDF
Site Summary (RSS) files. This distribution also contains many examples
that allow you to generate HTML from an RSS, convert between 0.9, 0.91,
and 1.0 version, and other nifty things. This might be helpful if you
want to include news feeds on your Web site from sources like Slashdot
and Freshmeat or if you want to syndicate your own content.

XML::RSS currently supports 0.9, 0.91, and 1.0 versions of RSS. See
http://backend.userland.com/rss091 for information on RSS 0.91. See
http://www.purplepages.ie/RSS/netscape/rss0.90.html for RSS 0.9. See
http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/ for RSS 1.0.

RSS was originally developed by Netscape as the format for Netscape
Netcenter channels, however, many Web sites have since adopted it as a
simple syndication format. With the advent of RSS 1.0, users are now
able to syndication many different kinds of content including news
headlines, threaded measages, products catalogs, etc.
