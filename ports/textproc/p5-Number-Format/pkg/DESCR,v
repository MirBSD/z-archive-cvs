@Number::Format is a library for formatting numbers.  Functions are
provided for converting numbers to strings in a variety of ways,
and to convert strings that contain numbers back into numeric form.
The output formats may include thousands separators - characters
inserted between each group of three characters counting right to
left from the decimal point.  The characters used for the decimal
point and the thousands separator come from the locale information
or can be specified by the user.
