@Zoem is an interpretive macro/programming language.

It can be used as an allround macro language, but has more
specialized uses as well.  One such specific use is its support
for creating small mark-up languages that map to different
devices (creating manual pages and FAQs for HTML, troff, and
Postscript).  Zoem has character filtering capabilities tailored
to this application.  It can also be used for general practical
document creation, allowing semantic mark-up, abstraction from
repeated (mark-up) elements, centralized control, automatic
generation of TOC sections, and more of that cruft.
