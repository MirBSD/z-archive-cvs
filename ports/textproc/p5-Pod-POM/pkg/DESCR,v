@This module implements a parser to convert Pod documents into a
simple object model form known hereafter as the Pod Object Model.
The object model is generated as a hierarchical tree of nodes, each
of which represents a different element of the original document.
The tree can be walked manually and the nodes examined, printed or
otherwise manipulated.  In addition, Pod::POM supports and provides
view objects which can automatically traverse the tree, or section
thereof, and generate an output representation in one form or
another.
