@Add a package for Text:Quoted. From DESCR:

Text::Quoted examines the structure of some text which may contain
multiple different levels of quoting, and turns the text into a nested
data structure.

The structure is an array reference containing hash references for each
paragraph belonging to the same author. Each level of quoting
recursively adds another list reference.
