@Initial revision

@This is a Perl extension to XML::Parser. It adds a new 'Style' to
XML::Parser, called 'Dom', that allows XML::Parser to build an
Object Oriented datastructure with a DOM Level 1 compliant interface.
For a description of the DOM (Document Object Model), see
http://www.w3.org/DOM/

This is a beta version and although there will not be any major API
changes, minor changes may occur as feedback is obtained from the
people on the perl-xml mailing list.  You can subscribe to this
list by sending a message to subscribe-perl-xml@@lyris.activestate.com.
