@c2html is  a  syntax highlighter for C   source  code that produces  a
highlighted html   file as  output. The output   can  be  read by  any
graphical WWW-Browser.  If the  browser understands the tags to change
font colors  (as Netscape does) the  output will look like highlighted
by emacs.  Otherwise it will  not look  so   nice, but readability  is
increased too.
