@ScrollKeeper is a cataloging system for documentation on open systems.
It manages documentation metadata (as specified by the Open Source Metadata
Framework(OMF)) and provides a simple API to allow help browsers to find,
sort, and search the document catalog.

It will also be able to communicate with catalog servers on the Net to search
for documents which are not on the local system.
