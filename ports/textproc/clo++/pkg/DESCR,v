@clo++ is a command line option parser generator for C++. 
It generates a C++ header file with a class that can parse your
command line and supports just about anything that you want to do
with your command line. It also generates usage information and
can handle subcommands that take their own options. clo++ is itself
written in C++ and uses a command line option parser that it
generated.
