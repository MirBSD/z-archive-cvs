1.1
log
@add a port of GNU groff, with a 'console' flavour, selected by default,
preventing dependencies on netpbm, ghostscript and psutils, but containing
only text (no HTML, PS, PDF, DVI, printer, X11, etc.) output and not all
tools; documentation is splitted for licence reasons

took me the better part of the afternoon and evening, now I'd better
get lunch ;) tested on and designed for MirOS, should be usable on
Interix as well
