@This is the Plan 9 compiler suite, taken from Inferno.
It also comes with iar (an ar(1) lookalike),
mk (some sort of make(1) tool), mkext (archiver)
and associated utilities, but no libraries.

Note: this port uses /usr/libexec/cpp as C Preprocessor,
which should be GNU cpp or pcc cpp, instead of hardcoding
Reiser CCCP. Configurable in: ${PREFIX}/bin/9cpp

You can't do anything useful with this compiler unless
you write your own startup files and libraries. 8l can
only generate COFF (-H1) and some even weirder oformats.

@add a port of the Plan 9 compiler, under MIT licence(yes!)
not quite useful though, e.g. there's no ELF support, and
I seem to be unable to run the COFF binaries (lest alone
the "garbage", Plan 9, MS-DOS .COM, MS-DOS .EXE ones ;)
nor do I have startup files or libraries... also, the .8
intermediate object format is unknown to libbfd, sadly.

Note: this port uses /usr/bin/cpp as C Preprocessor,
which is "always there", instead of hardcoding Reiser
CCCP which is there on MirOS only. See ${PREFIX}/bin/9cpp.
