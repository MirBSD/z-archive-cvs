1.1
log
@add a port of the Plan 9 compiler, under MIT licence(yes!)
not quite useful though, e.g. there's no ELF support, and
I seem to be unable to run the COFF binaries (lest alone
the "garbage", Plan 9, MS-DOS .COM, MS-DOS .EXE ones ;)
nor do I have startup files or libraries... also, the .8
intermediate object format is unknown to libbfd, sadly.
