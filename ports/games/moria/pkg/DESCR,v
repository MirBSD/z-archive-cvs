@The game is set in Moria and the goal is to kill off the balrog.
Apart from this, the game is almost completely based on Dungeons &
Dragons. The game is a true classic and every true gamer should
have played it.

It was originally written by Robert Alan Koeneke with some help
from Jimmy Wayne Todd. Further development of the game has almost
ceased, but The Pits of Angband, which is based on its code, is
still very much in development.
