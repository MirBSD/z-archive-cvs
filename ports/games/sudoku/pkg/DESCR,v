@Add a port for the sudoku console game. From DESCR:

Sudoku has taken the world by storm, but there is a definite lack of
console based sudoku games! So here is a candidate - written for Minix,
and ported to general Unix systems and Microsoft Windows. All source
code is available, and has been released into the public domain.

This program features a character-based (curses) interface.
