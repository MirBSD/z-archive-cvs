@Corewars is a simulation game where a number of warriors try to crash 
each other while they are running in a virtual computer. The warriors 
can be written in one of two assembler-like languages called Corewars 
and Redcode. Corewars is the default language  and is easier to learn 
and understand. Redcode provides more advanced and powerful 
instructions but also requires more time to learn.
