@revive frozen-bubble 1.0, it's less than one tenth the size.
sync patches between the two and fix DESCR.

(no bump to frozen-bubble 2.0 PKGNAME, despite it would be
deserved, since I don't require a recompile.)

@An amazingly cute game of popping bubbles.  Full-featured, colorful
3D rendered penguin animations (eye candy), 100 levels of 1p game,
hours and hours of 2p game, nights and nights of 2p/3p/4p/5p game
over LAN or Internet, a level-editor, 3 professional quality digital
soundtracks, 15 stereo sound effects, 8 unique graphical transition
effects, 8 unique logo eye-candies.

More than ever, you really need this game.

If you don't need the (LAN or Internet) networked multi-player and
this port is too heavy on your system resources, try frozen-bubble
1.0 in ports/games/frozen-bubble1 instead.
