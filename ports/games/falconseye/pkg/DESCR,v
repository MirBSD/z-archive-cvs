@Falcon's Eye is nethack.  
With a graphical interface.
With sound.

This port features per-user config: when you first start Falcon's Eye,
it creates $HOME/.falcon and copies default configuration files there,
that you can then edit.

You may wish to install timidity to get music instead of sound effects.
