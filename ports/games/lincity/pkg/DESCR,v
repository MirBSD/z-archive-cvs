@LinCity is a city/country simulation game.  You are required to build
and maintain a city.  You must feed, house, provide jobs and goods for
your residents.  You can build a sustainable economy with the help of
renewable energy and recycling, or you can go for broke and build
rockets to escape from a pollution ridden and resource starved planet,
it's up to you.  Due to the finite resources available in any one place,
this is not a game that you can leave for long periods of time.
