@Since I lost this port's distfile some months ago anyway,
increase its day by one, use the CVS fetch method, and
fix it (so it builds as user but with sudo).

also, disable huntd(6) because it includes <tcpd.h> which
doesn't exist on all platforms (someone to make it depen-
dent on -DTCP_WRAPPERS ?) and move manual pages around.
