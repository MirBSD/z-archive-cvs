@• sync extra fortunes with 2004-10-07 (from tarball)
  From: Alexander Bartolich <alexander.bartolich@@gmx.at>
• convert fortune cookies to utf-8 on !openbsd !interix
• bring back huntd(6) for systems with tcp_wrappers,
  an informative message echoing shell script otherwise
• offer people to host their fortune cookie collections
  in our CVS
• rm -rf /var/games on pkg_delete -c
@

@These are the games you'd normally expect to come
with the BSD base system installation, thrown out
for space and code cleanliness reasons.

The "potentially offensive fortunes" data file is
stored in clear text. Beware, Americans!

Special fortune cookie files found on the internet
have been added to your delight. Feel free to drop
me a message if you want more, or even maintain an
additional file inside our CVS.

On all operating systems except OpenBSD and Interix,
fortune cookie files are converted to UTF-8 standard.

huntd(6) is not included because it uses libwrap,
not a part of MirOS since, uh, long.
