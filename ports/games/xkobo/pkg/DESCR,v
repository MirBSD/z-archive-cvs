@       Xkobo  is  a  single player action game. The play is quite
       simple. Your object is to destroy all the fortresses.  You
       can control your ship by pressing the cursor keys (or mov-
       ing the mouse cursor), and  shoot beams  by  pressing  the
       SHIFT  key  (or  the  left  mouse button). The game can be
       paused by pressing 's' (or the right mouse button).

       On recent machines, consider the kobodeluxe port instead: sdl
       support yields better gameplay on non 8 bits or large displays,
       at the expense of an sdl dependency.

Available flavour:

	makes the game slightly harder by not giving you bonus lives
