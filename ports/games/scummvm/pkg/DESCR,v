@ScummVM is an implementation of LucasArts S.C.U.M.M. (Script Creation
Utility for Maniac Mansion) interpreter, used in games such as Monkey
Island, Indiana Jones, Day Of The Tentacle, Sam and Max, and many more.
Some things are still missing, and some games cannot be completeted yet.
There are quite a few known bugs.  Regardless of the bugs it is already
possible to play some games all the way through to the end.

Note that you must possess the original games to play.
