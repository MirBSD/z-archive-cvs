@Heroes is similar to the "Tron" and "Nibbles" games of yore, but
includes many graphical improvements and new game features. In
it, you must maneuver a small vehicle around a world and collect
powerups while avoiding obstacles.

Flavours:
	sdl	- build with the Simple DirectMedia Layer library
		and SDL_mixer for the sound interface
	ggi	- build with the Generic Graphics Library
		no sound support
