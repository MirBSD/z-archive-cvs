@Initial revision

@dopewars is a UNIX rewrite of a game originally based
on "Drug Wars" by John E. Dell. The idea of dopewars
is to deal in drugs on the streets of New York, amassing
a huge fortune and paying off the loan shark, while
avoiding the ever-annoying police. The UNIX rewrite, as
well as featuring a so-called "antique" mode which closely
follows the original, introduces new features such as the
ability to take part in multi-player games.
