@xsol plays a solitaire game similar to Klondike.  The playing field is
made up of seven slots, where stacks are built in descending value with
alternating suits.  Aces are built on at the top, and ascending order in the
same suit.   Kings can be moved to any empty space in the play-ing field.
The deck is gone through only once, card by card.

The cards are moved using the Left mouse button (Button1).
Pressing the button selects the card, and it (and any cards on it)
can then by dragged to its destination, where releasing will place them.
The deck cards are selected by clicking on them.
