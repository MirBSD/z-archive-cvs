@Wanderer is a game similar to Boulderdash, Repton, XOR and others.
A full description of how to play the game is given upon execution.
The hiscore table holds only 15 scores, and the name displayed is
taken from the environment variable NAME. If you wish to have a
different alias without changing this variable, you can set the
variable NEWNAME before playing.
