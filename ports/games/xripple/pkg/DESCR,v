@This is a port of xripple, written by the Rasterman, aka. Carsten Haitzler.

XRipple is a program that causes the bottom of the screen to ripple, like
a pool of water.  Not much else to say, really.

Carsten's ultra-cool homepage is at http://www.rasterman.com/ with more
cool stuff.

Note that xripple has no "official" version number.
