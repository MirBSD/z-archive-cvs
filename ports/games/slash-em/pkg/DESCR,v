@This is slash'em.  Will you dare explore this dungeon, kill creepier 
monsters, and even finish the game ?   At least, you're starting with 
a bonus: a servant creature to help you.

This is a sequel to nethack: more classes, more objects, bigger dungeon,
more difficult.

- in order to use slash with'em X11 graphics, you will have to add
${PREFIX}/lib/X11/fonts/hack to your fontpath, see xset(1) and Xserver(1), also
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm or /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit for proper configuration.

- the tty with colors mode expects a black background and white foreground to 
run properly, e.g., xterm -fg white -bg black

Flavours:
no_x11
	includes only the tty interface
qt
	includes qt interface

P.S. This is a very addictive game, with its whole wacky culture. And even
   a newsgroup dedicated to it (rec.games.roguelike.nethack). Don't say we
   didn't warn you !
