@xmine is an X11-based version of the popular PC game Minesweeper. The
object is to place flags on mines on the game board without exposing
them.

xmine is freely redistributable.  It's mostly Xlib-based, but it
requires Motif libraries for the menus.

Author: Paul Falstad (pf@@z-code.com)
===

This version of xmine is based on Paul Falstad's version 1.0.3, as
published in comp.sources.x. It has been heavily munged to work
without OSF/Motif.

Since the game itself has some 3D look, linking against the famous
Xaw3d library is highly recommended.
