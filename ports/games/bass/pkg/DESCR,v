@Beneath a Steel Sky is a 2D point-and-click science fiction thriller set
in a bleak vision of the future, originally published for DOS and the
Amiga.  You are Robert Foster, an innocent outsider stranded in a vast
city where oppressed civilians live and work in soaring tower blocks...
whilst the corrupt, covetous and rich live underground, safe from all
pollution.  Alone, save for a robot circuit board, Foster must fight for
survival - and discover the sinister truth behind both his own past and
the city he has found himself trapped in.
