@GNU Go plays a game of Go against the user. It has many other
features: it can play against itself or another program, analyse
and score a recorded game. GNU Go is compliant with Go modem
protocol, load and save games in the Smart Go format.
GNU Go default is a simple alpha-numeric board display, but you
can use a client such as CGoban.
