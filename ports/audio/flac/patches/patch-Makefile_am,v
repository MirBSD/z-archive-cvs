1.1
log
@* convert to automake
* as a side effect, lib-link.m4 is no longer used
* with the new LOCALBASE/giconv/ layout, both GNU
  and base libiconv are found and linked correctly
* disable XMMS support - xmms.m4 is not found during
  aclocal time since we do not have a build dependency
  on it nor ever built the xmms plugin
* as another side effect, HTML API documentation is there
