@NSPmod is a MOD (Protracker module and some of its extensions) / S3M
(Scream Tracker 3 module) / MTM (Multitracker module) music player.
This program uses a technology called No Signal Processor (NSP), which
enables your PC play MODs without DSP such as Gravis UltraSound (GUS)
GF1.

This program requires VoxWare v2.90 compatible 8bit DAC device.

I, John-Mark Gurney, have added support for output in 16bits.  The
volume level is slightly less than the 8bit version though.
