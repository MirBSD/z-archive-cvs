@Bonk is a high quality audio compression program.  It can operate in
either lossless or lossy mode.  In lossless mode, the exact original
WAV file can be recovered from the compressed file.  In lossy mode,
some information is discarded in the compressed file, yielding a much
higher compression ratio.  The information discarded is perceptually
unimportant, and the result should be a *perceptually* lossless encoding.
Bonk can compress some types of sounds more than others, so the actual
bit-rate achieved varies.

Bonk differs from most existing lossy coders in that it does not
use a Fourier transform to analyse the audio.  Instead it uses a
linear predictor (as used in speech compression) with a very high tap
count.
