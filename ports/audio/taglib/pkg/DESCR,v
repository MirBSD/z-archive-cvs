@Add a port for taglib-1.4-0, dependency for audacious-plugins (and other
media players that we do not have).
@
text
@TagLib is a library for reading and editing the meta-data of several
popular audio formats. Currently it supports both ID3v1 and ID3v2 for
MP3 files, Ogg Vorbis comments and ID3 tags and Vorbis comments in FLAC
files as well as MPC. 

TagLib is written in clean, object oriented C++ using a programming
style common in KDE and Qt library programming.
