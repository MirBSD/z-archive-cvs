1.2
log
@Update streamripper to 1.61.27-0, correcting some of the more obvious
mistakes in the port:

- missing dependency on libmad, ogg, and vorbis. The latter ones are new but
  libmad is not.
- put the manpage in the package.

Seriously, does no one over at obsd check the ports before committing?
