@Lopster is a full featured Napster Client developed in C using the 
GTK user interface.  Napster is a protocol for sharing MP3 files 
between users.  With Napster, the files stay on the client machine, 
never passing through the server. The server provides the ability to 
search for particular files and initiate a direct transfer between the 
clients. In addition, chat forums similar to IRC are available.
