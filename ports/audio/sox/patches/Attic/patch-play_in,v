1.2
log
@Update sox to 12.17.7, from OpenBSD. Now contains all our patches, wohoo :)
However, kludge around an infrastructure bug:

MirPorts automatically includes <bsd.own.mk> via EXTRA_SYS_MK_INCLUDES.
This seems to make "crtbegin0.o" the default target, breaking "make" without
a target, because of the following line:

${CRTBEGIN} ${CRTEND} ${CRTI} ${CRTN}: .OPTIONAL

tg: can we do anything about this?
