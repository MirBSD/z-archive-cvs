@SoX (also known as Sound eXchange) translates sound samples between
different file formats, and optionally applies various sound effects.
SoX is intended as the Swiss Army knife of sound processing tools.
It doesn't do anything very well, but sooner or later it comes in
very handy.

Available flavours that add support for additional file formats:

* vorbis        Ogg Vorbis compressed audio
* mp3           MP3 compressed audio
