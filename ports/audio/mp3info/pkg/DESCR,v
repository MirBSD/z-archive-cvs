@A small utility to read and write TAG info, as well as retrieve
the MP3 header info and print it all out in a nice format.

Features:
 - Get, Set and Wipe MP3 TAG Info.
 - Get MPEG Audio Version 1, 2 and 2.5 Header info.
 - User-definable output formatting (rather advanced).
 - Can rename files according to user-defined scheme.
