@Initial revision

@abcde is a front end command-line utility (actually, a shell script)
that grabs tracks off a CD, encodes them to ogg or mp3 format, and
tags and names them with data from a CDDB server, all in one go.

You may want to copy ${PREFIX}/share/examples/abcde/abcde.conf
to your homedir as .abcde.conf and adjust it to your needs.
