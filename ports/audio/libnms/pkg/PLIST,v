@Add a port for libnms-0.6.0. Patches (which fix configure bugs) will be
submitted upstream.

From DESCR:
libnms let you add multimedia streaming playback in your applications in
a quick and straightforward way. This software, derived from the
experience matured with NeMeSi is fully compliant with IETF's standards
for real-time streaming of multimedia contents over Internet. libnms
implements RTSP - Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RFC2326) and RTP/RTCP -
Real-Time Transport Protocol/RTP Control Protocol (RFC3550) supporting
the RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control
(RFC3551).
