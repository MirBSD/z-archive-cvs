@MAD (libmad) is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder. It currently supports
MPEG-1 and the MPEG-2 extension to Lower Sampling Frequencies, as well as
the so-called MPEG 2.5 format. All three audio layers (Layer I, Layer II,
and Layer III a.k.a. MP3) are fully implemented.

MAD does not yet support MPEG-2 multichannel audio (although it should be
backward compatible with such streams) nor does it currently support AAC.

MAD has the following special features:

- 24-bit PCM output
- 100% fixed-point (integer) computation
- completely new implementation based on the ISO/IEC standards
- distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL)
