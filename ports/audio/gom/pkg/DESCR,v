@gom is a generic audio mixer program; it tries to provide a complete and
convenient interface for all kind of audio mixer manipulation. gom's
facilities include sound driver (compile time) and sound card (run time)
independence, arbitrary mixer selection, loading and saving or mixer
settings, volume fading, verbosity-level driven output, "Un*x-like scripting
support", etc.

At the moment, gom only supports the Open Sound System (OSS) sound driver.
OSS comes with the Linux kernel as free software called OSS/Free, and is
available for a number of other platforms.

It comes with an internal terminal interface and an optional internal X
interface (xview).
