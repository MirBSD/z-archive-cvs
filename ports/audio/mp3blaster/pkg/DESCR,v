@Mp3blaster is an audio player with a user-friendly interface that will run
on any text console. The interface is built using ncurses, and features all
common audio player controls. The playlist editor is very flexible and allows
nested groups (albums). Supported audio media: mp3, ogg vorbis, wav, sid and
streaming mp3 over HTTP.
