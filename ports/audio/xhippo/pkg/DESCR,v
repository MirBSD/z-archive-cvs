@GNU xhippo is a generic playlist manager program for a variety of UNIX 
sound players. It's been shown to work with mpg123, bplay, s3mod, tracker,
xmp and timidity, and should work with more-or-less anything that can take 
a filename on the command line. 
It is capable of automatically deciding which player to use depending on 
a file's extension; the defaults are set in a config file. It uses textual 
playlist files, which are easily generated with the ``find'' or ``locate''
utilities. xhippo's interface is very loosely modelled on the ``HippoPlayer''
player for the Amiga.
