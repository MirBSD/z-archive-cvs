@Vorbis is a general purpose audio and music encoding format
contemporary to MPEG-4's AAC and TwinVQ, the next generation beyond
MPEG audio layer 3.  Unlike the MPEG sponsored formats (and other
proprietary formats such as RealAudio G2 and Windows' flavour of the
month), the Vorbis CODEC specification belongs to the public domain.
All the technical details are published and documented, and any
software entity may make full use of the format without royalty or
patent concerns.

This package contains:

- libvorbis, a BSD-license software implementation of the Vorbis
  specification by the Xiphophorus company.

- libvorbisfile, a BSD-license convenience library built on Vorbis
  designed to simplify common uses.

- libvorbisenc, a BSD-license library that provides a simple,
  programmatic encoding setup interface.
