@A program for adjusting audio mixers from the command line or
scripts, or interactively at the console or a terminal with a
full-screen, curses-based interface or a GTK-based X11 interface.

Flavours are available to disable the X11 and curses interfaces,
respectively.  The xaumix script is provided with the curses interface
to pop up an instance of aumix running in a new terminal window.
