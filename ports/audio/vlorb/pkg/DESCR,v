@vlorb is a console frontend for cdparanoia and CDDB.  It rips and
encodes tracks from an audio CD to Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, or WAV files.
The aim of vlorb is to create high-quality audio files in a simple
way, while providing a comfortable feature set.

vlorb uses CDDB to get CD information for tagging and file naming.
