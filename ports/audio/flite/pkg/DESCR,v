@Flite is a small fast run-time speech synthesis engine.  It is the
latest addition to the suite of free software synthesis tools
including University of Edinburgh's Festival Speech Synthesis System
and Carnegie Mellon University's FestVox project, tools, scripts and
documentation for building synthetic voices.  However, flite itself
does not require either of these systems to compile and run.
