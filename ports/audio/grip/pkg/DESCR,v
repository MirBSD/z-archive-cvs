@Grip is a front-end to external cd audio rippers (such as dagrab
or cdda2wav). It also provides an automated frontend for MP3 encoders,
letting you take a disc and transform it easily straight into MP3s.
The CDDB protocol is supported for retrieving track information
from disc database servers. Grip works with DigitalDJ to provide a
unified "computerized" version of your music collection.
