@SoundTracker is a music tracking tool for X11 similar in design to the
DOS program `FastTracker' and the Amiga legend `ProTracker'.

Packages can be built with additional FLAVOURs:

  gnome: SoundTracker built with gnome libraries. This is required
         by the graphical volume/panning envelope editors.

  esd:   SoundTracker built with the esound package.
