@libretto-config - Libretto BIOS Setting Program

 The `libretto-config' is a utility program to configure the BIOS
setting of the mini notebook computer, Toshiba Libretto. Changes to
the setting are immediately done, so rebooting is not necessary.
  I don't know whether these programs work on any other machines but
Libretto. In case of Toshiba's notebook machines, some function may 
work. 

*** Disclaimer *****************************************************
     The information used to write these programs was obtained by 
analyzing Libretto individually, not provided by Toshiba. Therefore,
they might contain fatal bugs and might cause damages to your 
Libretto. You can use them freely but the authors are not 
responsible for the programs. Redistribution of the programs are not
restricted, but you must attach this caution and the source.
