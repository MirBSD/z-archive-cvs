@ipmitool is a utility for managing and configuring devices that
support the Intelligent Platform Management Interface.  IPMI is an
open standard for monitoring, logging, recovery, inventory, and
control of hardware that is implemented independent of the main
CPU, BIOS, and OS.  The service processor (or Baseboard Management
Controller, BMC) is the brain behind platform management and its
primary purpose is to handle the autonomous sensor monitoring and
event logging features.

The ipmitool program provides a simple command-line interface to
this BMC.  It features the ability to read the sensor data repository
(SDR) and print sensor values, display the contents of the System
Event Log (SEL), print Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) inventory
information, read and set LAN configuration parameters, and perform
remote chassis power control.
