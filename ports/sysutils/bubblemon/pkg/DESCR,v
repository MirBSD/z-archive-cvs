@The Bubbling Load Monitor is a system CPU and memory load monitor for the
GNOME panel. It displays something that looks like a vial containing water.
The water level indicates how much memory is in use. The color of the liquid
indicates how much swap space is used (watery blue means none and angry red
means all).  The system CPU load is indicated by bubbles floating up through
the liquid; lots of bubbles means high CPU load.
