@The LPRng software is an enhanced, extended, and portable implementation
of the Berkeley LPR print spooler functionality.  While providing
the same interface and meeting RFC1179 requirements, the implementation
is completely new and provides support for the following features:
lightweight (no databases needed) lpr, lpc, and lprm programs;
dynamic redirection of print queues; automatic job holding; highly
verbose diagnostics; multiple printers serving a single queue;
client programs do not need to run SUID root; greatly enhanced
security checks; and a greatly improved permission and authorization
mechanism.
