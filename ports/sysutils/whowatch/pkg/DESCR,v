@whowatch is an interactive console utility that displays information
about the users currently logged on to the machine, in real time. 
Besides standard information (login, tty, host, user's processes) you
can see the type of login (i.e., ssh, telnet).
You can also see selected user's process tree or the system process 
tree.In the process tree mode there is the ability to send INT or KILL
signal to a selected process.
