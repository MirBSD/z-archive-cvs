@sdd is a replacement for dd(1).

- Much faster than dd in cases where input block size (ibs) is not equal
  to the output block size (obs).
- sdd does not share the design bugs of dd that cause fragments to be
  read from a pipe and filled up to input block size.
- Statistics are much better readable than from 'dd'.
- rmt support for if= & of=
- Output file is sync'd before doing statistic report.
- Timing available, -time option will print transfer speed
- Timing & Statistics available at any time with SIGQUIT (^\)
- Can seek on input and output
- Fast null input
- Fast null output
- Reblocking on pipes does not fill small input blocks to 
  input block size
- Debug printing
- Progress printing
