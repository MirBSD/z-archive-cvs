@A set of CGI scripts that can query a Nut based UPS and display information
and statistics on a web page.

By default the Nut CGIs are desinged to work within OpenBSD's chrooted
Apapche webserver.  If you disable the chroot feature you can use Apache's
SetEnv directive to override the configuration file location by setting
the NUT_CGICONFPATH environment variable.
