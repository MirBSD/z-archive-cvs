@FAM, the File Alteration Monitor, provides an API which applications can
use to be notified when specific files or directories are changed.

FAM comes in two parts: fam, the daemon which listens for requests and
delivers notification, and libfam, a library which client applications
can use to communicate with fam.

If the monitored files are mounted from a remote host, the local FAM
will attempt to contact FAM on the remote host, and will pass the
requests on to the remote FAM.

FAM can also notify its clients when a file starts and stops execution.
(The IRIX Interactive Desktop uses this to change a program's icon while
it's running, for example.)

This product includes software developed by the University of
California, Berkeley and its contributors.

@Add a port for fam-2.7.0-0, including native kqueue support.

This port is based on the one from NetBSD pkgsrc, who were also the ones
that implemented kqueue. Thanks a lot, guys! We owe you.
