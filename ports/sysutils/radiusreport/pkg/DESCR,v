@Radiusreport  can  produce  many varied reports by analysing
your  RADIUS  detail  files.  detail  files  can  be  uncom-
pressed/compressed/gzipped.

 o User online time reports (bandwidth used, etc.)
 o IP address usage.
 o Last login time reports.

As of V.02 radiusreport can generate  individual  files  for
each user by using the -o flag in conjunction with '-l all'.
This function will enable you to 'reprocess'  radiusreport's
output, e.g. to email a copy of each users report to them.
