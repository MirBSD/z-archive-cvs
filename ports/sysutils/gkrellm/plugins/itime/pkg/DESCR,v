@Gkrellmitime2 is the internet time plugin for Gkrellm2. 

	* The Internet Time is measured in ".beats".
	* One beat is the equivalent of 1 minute 26.4 seconds 
	  and a day is divided in 1000 beats.
	* The Internet Time is the same all over the world.
	* The Internet Time is based on a new meridian in Biel, 
	  Switzerland, the Biel MeanTime (BMT).
