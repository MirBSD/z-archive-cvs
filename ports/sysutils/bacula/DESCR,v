@Bacula comes by night and sucks the vital essence from your computers.

Bacula is a set of computer programs that permit you (or the system
administrator) to manage backup, recovery, and verification of computer
data across a network of computers of different kinds.  In technical
terms, it is a network Client/Server based backup program.  Bacula is
relatively easy to use and efficient, while offering many advanced
storage management features that make it easy to find and recover lost
or damaged files. Due to its modular design, Bacula is scalable from
small single computer systems to systems consisting of hundreds of
computers located over a large network.

This package contains the bacula-fd "backup agent" that gets installed
on the computers you want to back up.
