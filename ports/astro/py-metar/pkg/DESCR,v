@Pymetar is a python module and command line tool designed to fetch Metar
reports from the NOAA (http://www.noaa.gov) and allow access to the
included weather information.

To find a station ID, visit http://www.nws.noaa.gov/tg/siteloc.shtml
For instance, "Belgium/Bruxelles National" has the EBBR ID so a common 
usage of pymet2 would be:

  $ pymet2 EBBR

The default ID taken if none supplied in the command line is NZCM.
