‚Ä¢ _PASS_CC back from „Äåmpcc„Äç to „Äå${WRKDIR}/bin/mpcc„Äç (note that the
  former „Äå${WRKDIR:Q}/bin/mpcc„Äç was wrong)
‚Ä¢ all uses of _PASS_CC to either
  ‚Ä£ ${_PASS_CC:T:Q} (when passing, e.g. for libtool ‚Äì this is for use
    when ${WRKDIR}/bin is in $$PATH)
  ‚Ä£ ${_PASS_CC:Q} (when invoking, e.g. in post-build targets ‚Äì only
    these I saw when mechanically doing this; Benny wants to fix the
    remaining ones; I should‚Äôve introduced no more breakage than was)
‚Ä¢ _PASS_CXX/mpcxx just the same

@‚Ä¢ bsd.port.mk: improve heuristics for bzip2 distfile detection
‚Ä¢ bsd.port.mk: add LHarc (*.lzh/*.LZH but also *.lha seen)
  detection and handling
‚Ä¢ bsd.port.mk: add LZMA (with tar and cpio) detection and handling
‚Ä¢ bsd.port.mk: add jar/pdf/txi (simple copy) and uudecode handling
‚Ä¢ all: fold some of the more common cases into bsd.port.mk
‚Ä¢ pawn: adjust for WRKDIST vs WRKDIR difference

XXX some of the archives, especially plan9/*, now have a slightly
XXX different extract using ${_PERL_FIX_SHAR} ‚Äì Benny, please see
XXX if that broke anything

@mass conversion from

‚Ä¢ ${CC:Q}
to ${_PASS_CC:Q} (or without :Q if it‚Äôs executed, not assigned), and
