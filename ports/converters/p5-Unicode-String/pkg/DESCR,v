@These are experimental modules to handle various Unicode issues.  They 
were made before perl included native UTF8 support.                    
                                                              
The current set of modules are:                                        
                                                       
  Unicode::String   - represent strings of Unicode chars        
  Unicode::CharName - look up character names                        
  Unicode::Map8     - mapping tables towards 8-bit char sets         
                                                  
(the Unicode::Map8 module is distributed separately)
