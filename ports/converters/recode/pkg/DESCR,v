@GNU `recode' converts files between character sets and usages.  When
exact transliterations are not possible, it may get rid of the
offending characters or fall back on approximations.  This program
recognizes or produces nearly 150 different character sets and is able
to transliterate files between almost any pair.  Most RFC 1345
character sets are supported.
