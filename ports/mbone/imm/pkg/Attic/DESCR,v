@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@IMM has been designed to efficiently replicate files/file directories
using a reliable dissemination protocol framework and provide archiving
and post processing features.  The default mode of operation is for imm
to receive and display compressed imagery files (e.g., jpg,gif) using
xv or xloadimage as a post processor.

This release includes an sdr plug-in, named sdr2.plugin.S53.image.imm,
which must be installed to participate in MBone alpha testing of imm sessions.
Usually in a directory called ~home/.sdr/plugins to be found by sdr.
See the sdr help pages for information on installing plugins.
