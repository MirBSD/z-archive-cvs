@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@This is a beta-release of the LBL 'whiteboard'.

Before using wb, read the file NOTES from the distribution (note
especially the .sd.tcl change needed if you are running sd v1.14
or earlier) and print and read the postscript file lblwb.ps.

If you simply want a shared "whiteboard" drawing surface, you
don't need to do anything but install wb.  But wb can also be
used to export, view and annotate arbitrary PostScript files.
If you want to include PostScript images in your wb conference,
either your X server has to support Display PostScript (the DEC
& SGI X servers do) or wb has to be able to exec the public
domain postscript renderer `GhostScript'.  If you want to
render postscript with Ghostscript, it has to be installed on
your machine and has to be in your shell search path with the
name "gs".
