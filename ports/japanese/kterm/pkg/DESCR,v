@kterm is a xterm replacement with Japanese (Kanji) support.  It also
understands ANSI color sequences.  This version is 6.2.0, available
from the X11R6 contrib tape.

Also included is support for Xaw3d arrow-style scrollbars.  You can
now hold down the arrow buttons to scroll continuously.  Asashi Satomi 
made this patch for FreeBSD by modifying the source while looking 
at the xterm patch available with Xaw3d for R5.

Some more extensive patching was needed since part of kterm code is quite
old compared to recent X distributions.
