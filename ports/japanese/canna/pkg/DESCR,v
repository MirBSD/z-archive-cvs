@Canna is a Kana-Kanji conversion engine.
This package holds the Canna libraries.
For a fully functional system, you need access to a server,
or to install the cannaserver and cannadict packages as well.

Kana-kanji conversion is usually started with '^o'.

In theory, canna supports Mule (Multi-lingual emacs) and kinput2.

From NetBSD:
  To use from Mule (CANNA version), in .emacs file:

     (if (and (boundp 'CANNA) CANNA) ; Is it CANNA MULE?
        (progn
         (load-library "canna")
         (canna) ))

The nvi-m17n-*-canna package supports canna.
