@Enjoympeg is a MPEG-1 video player based on the source
of plaympeg from the SMPEG library.  It has a hideable
control bar which allows you to play/pause, stop, seek
and switch to fullscreen mode.

Features:
   - Hideable controlbar
   - Controlbar also available in fullscreen mode
   - Fullscreen support
   - It's a feature not a bug: Cursor hides when controlbar
     hides in fullscreen mode
   - Slider to seek in video
   - Shows frame when seeking finished
   - File dialog
   - File info dialog (shows information like current frame,
     fps when the info button is pressed while playing)
   - Preferences dialog
