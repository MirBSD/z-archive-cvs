@Libart is a library for high-performance 2D graphics.

Libart supports a very powerful imaging model, basically the same as SVG
and the Java 2D API. It includes all PostScript imaging operations, and
adds antialiasing and alpha-transparency.

Libart is also highly tuned for incremental rendering. It contains data
structures and algorithms suited to rapid, precise computation of Region
of Interest, as well as a two-phase rendering pipeline optimized for
interactive display.
