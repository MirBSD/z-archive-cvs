@libpixman is now called pixman, update from 0.1.x to 0.11.x o_O
needed for new cairo, which is needed for new firesomething

@libpixman is a merge of libpixregion and libic.
It also includes the slim headers.

libpixregion is a generic library for manipulating pixel regions. A
PixRegion is a set of Y-X banded rectangles that cover the desired
region.

The original code for libxregion was part of the reference X server
implementation of the X Window System. A modified copy of the code
also exists in the Xlib client library. libpixregion was formed so
that both the X server and client libraries could share common code
for region manipulation.

libpixregion is also intended to be applicable outside of the X Window
System. The public interface of libpixregion does not depend on any
part of the X Window System.

libic is a generic image compositing library. libic provides
Porter/Duff compositing of images and implicit mask generation for
geometric primitives including trapezoids, triangles, and rectangles.

The semantics of libic are designed to precisely match the
specification of the X Render extension. In fact, the initial
implementation of libic was lifted from the reference implementation
of RENDER from the X server.

However, libic is intended to be useful independent of the X Window
System. The public interface exported by libic does not contain any
X-specific data structures.

@Add ports for glitz and libpixman. These are dependencies for cairo, which
will be added soon.
