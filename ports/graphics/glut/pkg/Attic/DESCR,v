@replace GLUT with freeglut and enable BOINC graphics

(I can now successfully build the boinc5-API version
of Pirates@@HOME yello 6.08… now let’s see whether it
will manage to operate on any WUs as compat_linux(8)
is not up to the task – SIGFPE, dumps core.)

@The OpenGL Utility Toolkit, a window system independent toolkit for
writing OpenGL programs. It implements a simple windowing application
programming interface (API) for OpenGL.  GLUT is designed for
constructing small to medium sized OpenGL programs. While GLUT is
well-suited to learning OpenGL and developing simple OpenGL
applications, GLUT is not a full-featured toolkit so large applications
requiring sophisticated user interfaces are better off using native
window system toolkits like Motif.
