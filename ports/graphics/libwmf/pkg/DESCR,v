@libwmf is a library to parse and convert WMF graphic files into
other formats.  Currently, there exist drivers for PNG, EPS, SVG
(the XML-based W3C format), FIG, Magick, and others.  The library
is actively under development as part of the wvWare project, to
convert WMF graphics embedded in Microsoft file formats into a form
viewable from a web-browser.
