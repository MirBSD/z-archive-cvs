@spelling cleanup: “programme” is distinct from “program”; even in
British English, the latter is used for computer programs, while
the former serves for things like the TV programme, or a programme
to plant trees

@The program (two programs really - but they're just links to each
other) converts 48x48x1 images to and from a compressed format.  The
uncompressed images are expected to contain 48x48/4 (576) hex digits.
All other characters and any `0's followed by `X' or `x' are ignored.
Usually the files are 48 lines of "0x%04X,0x%04X,0x%04X,".  The
compressed images contain some number of printable characters.  Non
printable characters, including ` ' are ignored.  The purpose of the
program is to allow the inclusion of face images within mail headers
using the field name `X-face: '.
