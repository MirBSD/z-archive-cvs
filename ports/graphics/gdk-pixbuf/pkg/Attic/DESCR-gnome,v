@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@The GdkPixbuf library is a replacement for Imlib.  GdkPixbuf provides 
the following: a basic data structure to provide reference-counted images, 
functions to load images synchronously from disk or progressively from 
arbitrary data buffers, and convenience functions to transform pixbufs 
and render them to drawables. 

The GNOME Canvas Pixbuf library.
