@This library is the core of the gphoto2 software. It gives access to
almost 300 digital cameras 
(see http://gphoto.sourceforge.net/proj/libgphoto2/support.php for a 
list of supported cameras).

It uses abstractions to handle the communication port (serial/usb 
protocols) and the camera model separately.
