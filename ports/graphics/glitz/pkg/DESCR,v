@Add ports for glitz and libpixman. These are dependencies for cairo, which
will be added soon.

Original OpenBSD ports by Eric Faurot <eric.faurot at gmail.com>

@Glitz is an OpenGL image compositing library. Glitz provides
Porter/Duff compositing of images and implicit mask generation for
geometric primitives including trapezoids, triangles, and rectangles.

The semantics of glitz are designed to precisely match the
specification of the X Render extension. Glitz does not only implement
X Render features like component alpha and image transformations, but
also support for additional features like convolution filters and
color gradients, which are not currently part of the X Render
specification.

The performance and capabilities of glitz are much dependent on
graphics hardware. Glitz does not in any way handle software
fall-backs when graphics hardware is insufficient. However, glitz will
report if any requested operation cannot be carried out by graphics
hardware, hence making a higher level software layer responsible for
appropriate actions.

Glitz can be used as a stand-alone layer above OpenGL but is also
designed to act as a backend for cairo, providing it with OpenGL
accelerated output.
