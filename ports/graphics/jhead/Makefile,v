@change
‚Ä¢ _PASS_CC back from „Äåmpcc„Äç to „Äå${WRKDIR}/bin/mpcc„Äç (note that the
  former „Äå${WRKDIR:Q}/bin/mpcc„Äç was wrong)
‚Ä¢ all uses of _PASS_CC to either
  ‚Ä£ ${_PASS_CC:T:Q} (when passing, e.g. for libtool ‚Äì this is for use
    when ${WRKDIR}/bin is in $$PATH)
  ‚Ä£ ${_PASS_CC:Q} (when invoking, e.g. in post-build targets ‚Äì only
    these I saw when mechanically doing this; Benny wants to fix the
    remaining ones; I should‚Äôve introduced no more breakage than was)
‚Ä¢ _PASS_CXX/mpcxx just the same

‚Ä¢ ${CC:Q}
to ${_PASS_CC:Q} (or without :Q if it‚Äôs executed, not assigned), and
