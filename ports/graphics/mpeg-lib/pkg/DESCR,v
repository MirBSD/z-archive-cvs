@The MPEG Library is a collection of C routines to decode MPEG movies
and dither them in a variety of colour schemes.  Most of the code in
the library comes directly from the Berkeley MPEG player, an
X11-specific implementation that works fine, but suffers from minimal
documentation and a lack of modularity.  A front end to the Berkeley
decoding engine was developed by Greg Ward at the Montreal
Neurological Institute in May/June 1994 to facilitate the development
of an MPEG player specifically for Silicon Graphics workstations; the
decoding engine together with the MNI front end constitute the MPEG
Library.
