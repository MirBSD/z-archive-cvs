1.2
log
@Here is what I have been doing during 23c3:

Update the rest of Gtk+ and dependencies to their current version. Tested on Mac
OS X (during the congress) and MirOS/i386 (23c3 edition).

Some notes:
- cairo does not have the svg backend enabled as our librsvg port needs Gtk+,
  which needs cairo.
- Gtk+ builds a CUPS printing backend when CUPS is available, I should make this
  a flavour.
- tg@@, please resurrect glib 2.12 as I am useless with CVS merging.
