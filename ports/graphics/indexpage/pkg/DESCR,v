@Indexpage.pl generates one or more index pages and the corresponding
thumbnails for displaying images from a digital camera or similar on
the web (as of right now, only .jpg images are recognized). If there
are more images available than will fit on one page with the specified
number of rows and columns, indexpage.pl will generate more than one
page, each with a navigator to easily reach the other pages. The pages
will be called "index.html", "2.html", "3.html", and so on.
