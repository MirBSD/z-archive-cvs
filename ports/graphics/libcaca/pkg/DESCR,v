@The libcaca library is a graphics library that outputs text instead of
pixels, so that it can work on older video cards or text terminals.  It
is not unlike the famous AAlib library.  libcaca needs a terminal to
work, thus it should work on all Unix systems using either the slang
library or the ncurses library.
