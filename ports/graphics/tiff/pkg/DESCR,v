@* libjpeg: add support for "old jpeg" hunk from libtiff's contrib section
* libtiff: remove --with-jpeg-*-dir so that it does not add -L/usr/mpkg/lib
  to the command line -> doesn't link against an already installed libtiff
* libtiff: speed up build a lot (--disable-dependency-tracking and
  --disable-libtool-lock)
* libtiff: enable rpaths while here
  (sorry Benny)
* libtiff: remove no longer needed workaround
* libtiff: enable "old jpeg" support (pulls in jpegint.h temporarily tho)
* xloadimage: correct error condition abuse leading to false error message
* all: fix indenting in Makefile; sync DESCR, PLIST, distinfo; bump version

@This software provides support for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), a
widely used format for storing image data.

Included in this software distribution is a library, libtiff, for
reading and writing TIFF, a small collection of tools for doing simple
manipulations of TIFF images on UNIX systems, and documentation on the
library and tools. A small assortment of TIFF-related software for
UNIX that has been contributed by others is also included.

The library is capable of dealing with images that are written to
follow the 5.0 or 6.0 TIFF spec.  There is also considerable support
for some of the more esoteric portions of the 6.0 TIFF spec, and
even "old JPEG" (as by ancient Wang Imaging versions).
