@GIMP is an acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is a
freely distributed program for such tasks as photo retouching, image
composition and image authoring.

It has many capabilities. It can be used as a simple paint program,
an expert quality photo retouching program, an online batch processing
system, a mass production image renderer, an image format converter,
etc.

GIMP is expandable and extensible. It is designed to be augmented
with plug-ins and extensions to do just about anything. The advanced
scripting interface allows everything from the simplest task to the
most complex image manipulation procedures to be easily scripted.
