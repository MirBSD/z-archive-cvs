@Developed as the in-house software of a high quality animation
studio, Blender has proven to be an extremely fast and versatile
design instrument. The software has a personal touch, offering a
unique approach to the world of Three Dimensions. Use Blender to
create TV commercials, to make technical visualizations, business
graphics, to do some morphing, or design user interfaces. You can
easy build and manage complex environments. The renderer is versatile
and extremely fast.  All basic animation principles (curves & keys)
are well implemented.
