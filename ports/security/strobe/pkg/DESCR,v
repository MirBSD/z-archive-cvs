@strobe   is  a  network/security  tool  that  locates  and
describes all listening tcp ports on a (remote) host or on
many hosts in a bandwidth utilisation maximising, and pro-
cess resource minimizing manner.

strobe approximates a parallel finite state machine inter-
nally. In non-linear multi-host mode it attempts to appor-
tion bandwidth and sockets amoung  the  hosts  very  effi-
ciently.   This  can  reap  appreciable gains in speed for
multiple distinct hosts/routes.
