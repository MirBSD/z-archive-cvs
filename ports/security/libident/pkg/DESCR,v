@COPYRIGHT ISSUES:

	This version of 'libident' is hereby released into the
	Public Domain. It may be distributed for a fee or without
	a fee. We only ask you not to pretend you wrote it.

If you make any changes, please send sources or a diff of it to
us (pen@@lysator.liu.se or pell@@lysator.liu.se), so we can keep
_one_ unified version of libident available...

COMMENTS:

This is the second stab at a small library to interface to the Ident
protocol server. Maybe this will work correctly on some machines.. :-)
 
The ident-tester.c file is a small daemon (to be started from Inetd)
that does an ident lookup on you if you telnet into it. Can be used
to verify that your Ident server is working correctly.
 
I'm currently running this "ident-tester" on port 114 at lysator.liu.se
(130.236.254.1) if you wish to test your server.
