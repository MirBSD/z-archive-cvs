@bfbtester is a quick hack I put together to do some basic overflow
tests on binary programs. It probably won't catch everything wrong or
every program, but it's pretty good at catching the bad
ones. bfbtester can either run tests on a single binary or walk
through a whole directory of binaries. Currently bfbtester tests for
argument overflows and environment variable overflows.
