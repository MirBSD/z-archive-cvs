@bsd-airtools provides a complete toolset for wireless 802.11b auditing.
Namely, it contains a curses-based AP detection application, dstumbler,
that is similar to netstumbler.  It can be used to detect wireless
access points and connected nodes, view signal to noise graphs, and
interactively scroll through scanned APs and view statistics for each.
It also contains a BSD-based WEP cracking application, called dweputils.
Finally, this package includes several tools to allow testing and
analysis of all 14 of the prism2 chipset's debug modes.
