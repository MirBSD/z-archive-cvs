@What is the Nessus Project ?

   The aim of the Nessus project is to provide the internet community a
   free, open-sourced and easy-to-use security auditing tool.
     * Free: Nessus is free because most societies/universities
       practically ignore their network security issues out of fear that
       it would cost too much to fix.  They don't know if it would be
       worth paying a security expert to audit their network.  By not
       paying attention to security, those societies/universities are
       subject to the actions of darkside hackers, and the results are
       usually quite upsetting...
     * Open-sourced: Nessus is open-sourced primary because such a
       sensitive program could be suspected to be a trojan horse, and
       second to promote volunteer efforts at improving and adding
       features.
     * Easy-to-use: Nessus is easy-to-use because computer security is
       not an easy thing.  Thus, the Nessus project provides a simple
       interface which clearly highlights the security holes.
