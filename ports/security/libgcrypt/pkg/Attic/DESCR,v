@This is a general purpose cryptographic library based on the
code from GnuPG. It provides functions for all cryptograhic 
building blocks: symmetric ciphers (AES, DES, Blowfish, CAST5,
Twofish, Arcfour), hash algorithms (MD4, MD5, RIPE-MD160, SHA-1,
TIGER-192), MACs (HMAC for all hash algorithms), public key
algorithms (RSA, ElGamal, DSA), large integer functions, random
numbers and a lot of supporting functions.
