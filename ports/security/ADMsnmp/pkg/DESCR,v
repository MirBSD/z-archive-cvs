                         [ ADMsnmp v 0.1 ]
                      * SNMP audit scanner *

ADMsnmp is an snmpd audit scanner.
Any of you know how weak and funny snmp is?
You can obtain a great deal of usefull info  like  admin name's, 
you can play with the interface of the router, reboot the machine
get the password file of the router (Ascend), or execute commands remotely,
anyway snmp is a BIG hole.

ADMsnmp can brute force the snmp community name (with a wordfile) or
make a wordfile list derived the hostname.
ADMsnmp can report to you all valid community
names found and inform you if writable access to the MIB has been attained.

ADMsnmp is very easy to use and designed with speed in mind!
