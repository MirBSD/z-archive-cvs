L0phtCrack 1.5 is a tool for turning Microsoft LANMAN and NT password
hashes back into the original clear text passwords.  The program
does this using dictionary cracking and also brute force.  L0phtCrack
1.5 returns not just the LANMAN password but the NT password up to 14
characters in length.

this port also includes readsmb, which will sniff the hashes for you.
