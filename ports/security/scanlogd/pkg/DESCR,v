@scanlogd is a TCP port scan detection tool by Solar Designer.

From the webpage:
   "scanlogd is a TCP port scan detection tool, originally designed to
    illustrate various attacks an IDS developer has to deal with.  Thus, 
    unlike some of the other port scan detection tools out there, scanlogd
    is designed to be totally safe to use."
