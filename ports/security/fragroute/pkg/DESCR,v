@fragroute intercepts, modifies, and rewrites egress traffic destined for
a specified host, implementing most of the attacks described in the
Secure Networks "Insertion, Evasion, and Denial of Service: Eluding
Network Intrusion Detection" paper of January 1998.

It features a simple ruleset language to delay, duplicate, drop,
fragment, overlap, print, reorder, segment, source-route, or otherwise
monkey with all outbound packets destined for a target host, with
minimal support for randomized or probabilistic behaviour.
