@change
â€¢ _PASS_CC back from ã€Œmpccã€ to ã€Œ${WRKDIR}/bin/mpccã€ (note that the
  former ã€Œ${WRKDIR:Q}/bin/mpccã€ was wrong)
â€¢ all uses of _PASS_CC to either
  â€£ ${_PASS_CC:T:Q} (when passing, e.g. for libtool â€“ this is for use
    when ${WRKDIR}/bin is in $$PATH)
  â€£ ${_PASS_CC:Q} (when invoking, e.g. in post-build targets â€“ only
    these I saw when mechanically doing this; Benny wants to fix the
    remaining ones; I shouldâ€™ve introduced no more breakage than was)
â€¢ _PASS_CXX/mpcxx just the same

@mass conversion from
â€¢ ${CC}
â€¢ "${CC}"
â€¢ '${CC}'
â€¢ ${CC:Q}
to ${_PASS_CC:Q} (or without :Q if itâ€™s executed, not assigned), and
same for CXXâ€¦ most of these are VERY UGLY, prone to break with ccache
and maybe even withoutâ€¦

@remove SEPARATE_BUILD for once and for good, I'm fed up with
all the trouble it can cause - ports which need it (e.g. the
GCC SC doesnt "support" building gcc with srcdir=objdir) can
set stuff like WRKBUILD themselves.
