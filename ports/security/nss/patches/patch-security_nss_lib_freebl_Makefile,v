@Add a port for NSS, the Network Security Services, a buggy piece of crap
needed by Firesomething. certdata.{c,txt} and patches from there.
From DESCR:

Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries provided by the
Mozilla project and designed to support cross-platform development of
security-enabled client and server applications. Applications built with
NSS can support SSL v2 and v3, TLS, PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS
#12, S/MIME, X.509 v3 certificates, and other security standards.
