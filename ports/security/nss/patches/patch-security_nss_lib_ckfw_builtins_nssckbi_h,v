@• update ca-certificates port with latest data
• update nsckbi in both nss (for package nss) and firesomething (for
  package nssckbi); if nss would create a subpackage nssckbi like
  firesomething does at the moment, and firesomething were to depend
  on nss and nssckbi instead of bringing their own¹, things would be
  MUCH better as it takes about 2 minutes per certdata.txt and 3-4
  minutes per certdata.c file to commit this

① maybe just build firesomething with its own nss and nssckbi but
  don’t include it in the binary package, rather use symlinks to
  the mirpackage for nss and nssckbi? or just depend on the extracted
  nss/nssckbi source tree (there’s at least one package that extracts
  jpeg and IIRC png during build in ports, so there’s precedent)

Benny, please consider cleaning up this situation.

@Add a port for NSS, the Network Security Services, a buggy piece of crap
needed by Firesomething. certdata.{c,txt} and patches from there.
From DESCR:

Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries provided by the
Mozilla project and designed to support cross-platform development of
security-enabled client and server applications. Applications built with
NSS can support SSL v2 and v3, TLS, PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS
#12, S/MIME, X.509 v3 certificates, and other security standards.
