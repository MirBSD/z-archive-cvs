@from watch.txt:

             Application: A tool designed to monitor directory
                activity, copy transient files based upon regular
                expression matching, syslog upon seeing links created,
                etc. etc.

             Severity: Just about every OS out there is replete
               with programs that insecurely handle files in
               publicly accessible temporary directories.
