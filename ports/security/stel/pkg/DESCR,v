@stel(1) is intented to be a simple and practical plug and play
solution for logging into a remote system or executing commands on
a remote system.  stel offers a variety of features which range
from mutual authentication to file transfer.  The security of stel
relies upon the underlying cryptographic desing, not trusting the
net in any way.  If no options are provided, stel defaults to triple
DES encryption, 1024-bits Diffie-Hellman modulus, no protection
from active attacks, and the remote system user's shell as the
command to be executed on the remote system.  This should be
reasonable for most systems, and it is believed to be a good
compromise between speed, ease of use and security.
