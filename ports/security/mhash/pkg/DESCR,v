@The mhash library provides an easy way to access strong hashes such as
MD5, SHA1 and other algorithms.

The mhash library provides the following features:

 o  Open-Source software (GNU Lesser General Public License)
 o  Useable for both commercial and non-commercial use
 o  Reentrancy support through POSIX threads 
 o  Support for known strong algorithms
 o  Support for less-known algorithms such as GOST
 o  Should work on every ANSI C conforming platform
