@AntiSniff is a new class of proactive security monitoring tool. It has
the ability to scan a network and detect whether or not any computers
are in promiscuous mode. This is often a sign that a computer has been
compromised. With AntiSniff, administrators and security teams can
finally get a handle on who is watching network traffic at their site.

AntiSniff was designed to detect compromized machines with IP stacks
that a remote attacker could utilize to sniff network traffic. It was
not designed to detect hardware based network probes or special
purpose network analyzers which an attacker would need physical access
to install.
