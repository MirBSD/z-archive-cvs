@HMAC is used for message integrity checks between two parties that
share a secret key, and works in combination with some other Digest
algorithm, usually MD5 or SHA-1.  The HMAC mechanism is described in
RFC 2104.

The Digest::HMAC module follow the common Digest:: interface, but the
constructor takes the secret key and the name of some other simple
Digest:: module as argument.
