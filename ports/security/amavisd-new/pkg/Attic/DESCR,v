@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@amavisd-new is a high-performance interface between mailer 
(MTA) and content checkers: virus scanners, and/or 
SpamAssassin. It is written in Perl for maintainability, 
without paying a significant price for speed. It talks to 
MTA via (E)SMTP or LMTP, or by using helper programs. Best
with Postfix, fine with dual-sendmail setup and Exim v4,
works with sendmail/milter, or with any MTA as a SMTP relay.
'Howto' for qmail available as well.
