@ccrypt is a utility for encrypting and decrypting files and streams. 
It was designed to replace the standard unix crypt utility, which is
notorious for using a very weak encryption algorithm. ccrypt is based 
on the Rijndael cipher, which is the U.S. government's chosen
candidate for the Advanced Encryption Standard. This cipher is believed 
to provide very strong security.
