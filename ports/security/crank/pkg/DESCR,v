@Crank is short for "CRyptANalysis toolKit", and its overall purpose
is to provide a powerful and extensible environment for solving
classical (pen-and-paper) ciphers, providing as much automation as
possible. Classical ciphers include common schemes like monoalphabetic
substitutions, where each letter of the alphabet is mapped to another
(usually different) letter consistently through the text. The first
version of Crank is restricting itself to these special ciphers. Other
algorithms forever devoid of Crank's attentions include Enigma, RSA,
DES, MurkelFish, or anything else invented after 1900.
