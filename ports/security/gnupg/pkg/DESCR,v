@update GnuPG to fix CVE-2012-6085

also, IDEA is no longer patented, we can include it
@
text
@GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage. It can be
used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures. It includes an
advanced key management facility and is compliant with the proposed
OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC 4880 (RFC 2440, RFC 1991).

GnuPG 1.4 is the standalone, non-modularized series. In contrast to the
version 2 series, shipped with the gnupg2 package, it comes with no
support for S/MIME and some other tools useful for desktop environments,
but also with less dependencies.

@* get rid of curl dependency
* handle hidden dependencies
* discover our tar (paxmirabilis)
* fix autofoo bugs
* don't scare the user with error messages
  (needs recent iconv.m4 update)
* reduce number of flavours: always build card support
  (libusb is a slim dependency)
* use no_idea flavour; enable IDEA by default
  (users must take care of patant licencing issues themselves)
* sync DESCR, distinfo

GnuPG is the GNU project's complete and free implementation of the
OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC2440. GnuPG allows to encrypt and
sign your data and communication, features a versatile key managment
system as well as access modules for all kind of public key
directories. GnuPG, also known as GPG, is a command line tool with
features for easy integration with other applications. A wealth of
frontend applications and libraries are available.

It has more security bugs than PGP 2.6.* and is only compatible with
the latter (e.g. in security/pgp+) if you don't use the no_idea
flavour.

GnuPG is a complete and free replacement for PGP. Because it does
not use IDEA or RSA it can be used without any restrictions. GnuPG
is nearly in compliance with RFC2440 (OpenPGP).
