@Clam Antivirus is an anti-virus scanner written from scratch. It is licensed
under GNU GPL2 and uses the virus database from OpenAntiVirus, which is an
another free anti-virus project. In contrast to the OpenAntiVirus (which is
written in Java), Clam Antivirus is written entirely in C and POSIX compliant.
