@AI::NeuralNet::Mesh is an optimized, accurate neural network Mesh.
It was designed with accuracy and speed in mind. 

This network model is very flexable. It will allow for clasic binary
operation or any range of integer or floating-point inputs you care
to provide. With this you can change activation types on a per node or
per layer basis (you can even include your own anonymous subs as 
activation types). You can add sigmoid transfer functions and control
the threshold. You can learn data sets in batch, and load CSV data
set files. You can do almost anything you need to with this module.
