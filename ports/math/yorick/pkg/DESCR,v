@Yorick is an interpreded language for scientific computing
and numerical analysis, very similar to Matlab.

Yorick's array syntax, interpreted programs are compact,
nearly free of explicit loops, and can run at speeds up to
20% of optimized compiled speed.

It can do interactive graphics via the X Window System,
including x-y plots, quadrilateral meshes and cell arrays.
Includes tools to assist making animated and simple 3d
graphs.

Supports output directly to your screen, in PostScript and
binary CGM format.
