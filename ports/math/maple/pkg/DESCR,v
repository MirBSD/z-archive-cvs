@Maple V.5 is a symbolic computation package developed at the University
of Waterloo. It's a bit outdated as far as programming languages go,
but it is very good for algebraic manipulations, integral calculus, and
so on.

This port uses the commercial `single user' version for i386-Linux.  It can
probably be extended easily for other versions.
