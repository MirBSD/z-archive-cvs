@This module implements some algorithms for calculating Fast Fourier
Transforms for one-dimensional data sets of size 2^n. The data,
assumed to arise from a constant sampling rate, is represented by
an array reference, which is then used to create a Math::FFT object.

Available methods include complex and real discrete fourier transforms,
convolution, power spectra and windowing functions, as well as some
statistical utilities.
