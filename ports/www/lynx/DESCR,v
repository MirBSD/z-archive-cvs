@Lynx is the standard text-oriented (console-based) web browser.

Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running
cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices such as vt100
terminals, vt100 emulators running on Windows 95/NT or Macintoshes, or
any other character-cell display. It will display Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML) documents containing links to files on the local
system, as well as files on remote systems running http, gopher, ftp,
wais, nntp, finger, or cso/ph/qi servers, and services accessible via
logins to telnet, tn3270 or rlogin accounts. Current versions of Lynx
run on Unix, VMS, Windows95/NT, 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.

Lynx can be used to access information on the WWW, Gopher, or to establish
information systems intended primarily for local access. Lynx has been
used to build several Campus Wide Information Systems (CWIS). Lynx can
also be used to build systems isolated within a single LAN.
