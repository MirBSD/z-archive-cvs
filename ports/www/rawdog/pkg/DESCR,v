@rawdog is an RSS Aggregator Without Delusions Of Grandeur. Written in
Python, it uses Mark Pilgrim's feed parser. It runs from cron, collects
articles from a number of feeds, and generates a static HTML page
listing the newest articles in date order. It supports per-feed
customizable update times, and uses ETags, Last-Modified, and gzip
compression to minimize network bandwidth usage.
