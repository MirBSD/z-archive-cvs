@mod_random provides three services.  The first service is as a
redirector.  You feed it URLs and it will redirect to random URLs
that you have loaded.  The second is that it provides environmental
variables that can be used for doing ad banner systems.  The third
is that it can be used to display entire pages of random html.  It
uses its own custom handlers in combination with random ads and
quotes that you feed into the system.
