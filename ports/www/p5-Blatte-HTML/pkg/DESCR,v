@The Blatte-HTML module defines Blatte functions corresponding to HTML tags,
making it possible to write Blatte that looks like this:

  Here is a {\a \href=http://www.blatte.org/ link}

that can be translated to this:

  Here is a <a href="http://www.blatte.org/">link</a>

The beauty is that you can use Blatte functions to encapsulate repeated
constructs.  For instance, this definition:

  {\define {\mypagestyle \=name \&content}
    {\html {\head {\title \name}}
           {\body {\h1 \name} \content}}}

allows you to write

  {\mypagestyle \name={A page I wrote} This is my page.}

which saves you from having to write:

  <html><head><title>A page I wrote</title></head>
  <body><h1>A page I wrote</h1>This is my page.</body></html>
