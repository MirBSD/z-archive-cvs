@mod_layout is an Apache module to wrap pages.  This means that you
can add at both the beginning (header) and the end (footer) of the
document some information.  By using the Layout directive, you can
actually dynamically insert layouts anywhere in the document. This
allows you to create a single look and feel throughout a website
without using server side includes (SSI) to "automagically" add
content in either of these two locations.
