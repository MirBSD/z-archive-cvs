@Merge bsiegert-ff3 branch into the trunk, replacing firesomething 2.0.

Also add missing dependency on dbus, MirOS ca patches. Connecting
to https://www.mirbsd.org works fine without a warning.

MidnightBSD people: please test this version on your OS. It _should_ run
but I did not have the opportunity to test it.

@Overhaul this by manually editing… do *not* use yet, I’ll have
to fix this on MidnightBSD. (No, do not use it on MirBSD yet,
either.)

Fixes:

• bring back diffs to port Makefile
  ‣ need <mirports.sys.mk> early
  ‣ PLIST for !OpenBSD !MirBSD differs
  ‣ s/MODGNU_CONFIG_GUESS_DIRS/MODGNU_RECURSE_DIRS/ (*cough*!)
  ‣ MidnightBSD support diffs
  ‣ fix for issue that binary could not be called
• use += for variables instead of =
  ‣ CONFIGURE_ARGS, CONFIGURE_ENV¹, *_DEPENDS, MODULES
  ‣ not for MAKE_ENV since = and += differ here (<bsd.port.mk> has
    a MAKE_ENV?= stanza)
  ‣ ① not here for CONFIGURE_ENV due to use of CONFIGURE_ENV+=MAKE_ENV,
    which is bad style (it would be better to use a common variable and
    add its content to both)
• yes, the list of OS names in GNUmakefiles is intended to be sorted
  ‣ pipe through sort -R' ' inside editor
  ‣ I actually like the fact that M comes before O in the alphabet ☺
• bring back MirBSD/sparc support diffs
• please do a “less /usr/ports/graphics/png/pkg/PLIST” some time

I also have a question about this diff:
│-+    OS_RELEASE="3.5" # XXX
│++    OS_RELEASE="3.9" # XXX
└ ‣ our kernel is OpenBSD 3.5-current based, and the OpenBSuxulator
    goes up to 3.8 – we do not have some syscalls (including their
    libc interface!) from 3.9 onwards. So why is this?
  ‣ for now, I kept it, as you apparently built firesomething, but…

@Ladies and Gentlemen, I present firesomething-2.0.0.13.
Patches are hand-merged.

Please verify that it still builds (and works!) on MidnightBSD and regen

@since bsiegert@@ won’t do it rather now than later, fix the firesomething
invocation issue myself (not tested)

also, while here, add midnightbsd to most places it’s needed (definitively
not all, since I can’t even mmake extract with what I’ve got left on HDD
space), so that they can start hacking on it (look at the last three parts
of patches/patch-nsprpub_configure_in for an idea what is missing)

XXX benny: why don’t we do EOVERFLOW? we have had it for a while

@Update firesomething to 1.5.0.3-0.

Our build is "unofficial" for trademark reasons and thus calls itself
"Deer Park" (the code name). The executable is called "firesomething", as
usual.

This probably needs -current, but it runs on my own -stable too (I have
rebuilt ld and src/lib from source). Don't even bother with it on #7.
