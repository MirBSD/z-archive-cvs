@Merge bsiegert-ff3 branch into the trunk, replacing firesomething 2.0.

Also add missing dependency on dbus, MirOS ca patches. Connecting
to https://www.mirbsd.org works fine without a warning.

MidnightBSD people: please test this version on your OS. It _should_ run
but I did not have the opportunity to test it.

@If you encounter strange problems related to bookmarks, dwnloads, window
placement, toolbars, history, or other settings, it is recommended that
you try creating a new profile and attempting to reproduce the problem
before filing bugs.

In order to create a new profile, start Firesomething with the the
-profilemanager switch, e.g. firesomething -profilemanager.

If firesomething doesn't start at all, first try and remove compreg.dat,
xpti.dat and extensions/Extensions.rdf in your profile directory or just
remove the old profile:

    rm -r ~/.mozilla/firefox/<profile-dir> ~/.firefox/<profile-dir>

@Update firesomething to 1.5.0.3-0.

Our build is "unofficial" for trademark reasons and thus calls itself
"Deer Park" (the code name). The executable is called "firesomething", as
usual.

This probably needs -current, but it runs on my own -stable too (I have
rebuilt ld and src/lib from source). Don't even bother with it on #7.
