@Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid
development and clean, pragmatic design.

Developed and used over two years by a fast-moving online-news
operation, Django was designed to handle two challenges: the intensive
deadlines of a newsroom and the stringent requirements of the
experienced Web developers who wrote it. It lets you build
high-performing, elegant Web applications quickly.
