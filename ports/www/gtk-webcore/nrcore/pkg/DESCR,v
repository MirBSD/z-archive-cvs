@Add ports for Gtk-Webcore, libs and the reference implementation. This is a
web browser for Gtk+ based on Apple's WebKit, which is in turn based on
KHTML.

This is alpha quality at the moment, but it seems usable and fast---not as
fast as dillo though.

@Gtk+ WebCore is a Linux/Gtk+ port of Apple Computer Inc.'s WebCore KHTML
html rendering engine including a web component. A reference browser
implementation is included in the project. Gtk+ WebCore is a standards
compliant (X)HTML rendering engine, javascript interpreter and an
embeddable web component. The purpose of the web component is to be a
light-weight, easy-to-compile and embed, open source rendering
component. 

This package contains the core rendering engine.
