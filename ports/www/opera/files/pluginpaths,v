1.1
log
@Create a new package, fedora-libs, from OpenBSD’s fedora_base and
fedora_motif, containing Fedora Core 4 libraries, by suggestion of
the MidnightBSD developers; convert Opera and AcroRead to use it,
tentatively; this fixes plugins in Opera, for instance, and possi-
bly opens the door for the Opera 9.5x upgrade – which MidnightBSD
doesn’t have yet either. While here sprinkle some uname checks for
mnbsd, fix the emulated ldd, and re-enable plugins/java for Opera

NOTE: This is EXPERIMENTAL.
