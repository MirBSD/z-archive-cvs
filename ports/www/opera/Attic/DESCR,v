@next try… this branch got fsck'd up totally

@Opera is a fast and customizable WWW browser.  Features:
– HTML 4.01
– XML
– CSS1 and CSS2
– SVG 1.1 Basic
– HTTP 1.1
– 128-bit encryption, TLS 1.0, SSL 2 and 3
– ECMAScript, JavaScript 1.3
– tabbed browsing
– partial DOM and WAP/WML
– support for Netscape plug-ins
– fast rendering of pages
– extensive drag-and-drop features
– easy keyboard navigation and shortcuts and early implementation
  of Opera’s unique mouse gestures
– fast-forward function guessing most probable “next page” link
– multiple windows support
– resume interrupted download sessions
– high quality zooming; Opera can zoom in on a page up to 1000%
– a powerful search capability with the added possibility of searching
  the user’s own Hotlist
– Fraud protection
– adding custom search engines easily
– Site preferences
– built-in BitTorrent client
– password manager
– Content blocker
– Pop-Up blocker
– Widgets – small web applications that run inside the browser
– thumbnail preview for tabs
– “reload from cache” and local editing ability
– integration with the W3C validator (press Ctrl-Alt-V)
– Sessions
– quick preferences function
– Notes
– Voice control
– “trash can” for resurviving closed tabs and blocked pop-ups
– simple way to delete all private, session, history, etc. data
– built-in IRC and eMail client
– language packs – while the default Opera download comes with
  US-English only, a variety of languages are available on the
  Opera website (some of which are (about to be) packaged with
  this port) or third-party sites. This port adds:
  • Lëtzebuergsch
– customisable skins; this port comes with the two default skins and:
  • Minimalist Native
– instant toggling of image and documents settings
– full-screen and kiosk modes
– small-screen mode support to aid web developers
– “speed dial”
– developer tools available at http://dev.opera.com/tools/
– Voluntary, anonymous usage statistics reporting feature
– improved rich text editing functions
– transfer manager
– accessibility functionality, e.g. Zoom, user-controllable text
  sizes, colours and even CSS
– info panel

Issues:
– there is a soft dependency on redhat_motif
– opera 8 might segfault with your old opera 7 configuration, in that
  case remove ~/.opera and start over
– no SunJDK, IBMjava under MirOS BSD for now, since we can only run
  the sunjdk/jre-1.3 stuff in the linux emulation (currently, Java
  is disabled in the port, but may come back once requested, but
  then only with the sunjre-1.3-linux stuff)
– read the install notice (“pkg_info -D opera”) before using

@commit not-quite-working update to Opera 9.50:
Jun 13 00:35:36 odem /bsd: signal 11 received by (opera:18754) UID(2999) EUID(2999), parent (mksh:17794) UID(2999) EUID(2999)

This (happening several times) includes core dumps (unless ulimit -c 0)
and occurs even if not using plugins.

@upgrade to Opera 9.61
• does not exit cleanly, needs SIGABRT most of the time (usually, though,
  SIGKILL works, but not always – Zombies –, some rare times SIGTERM or
  SIGINT work)
• leaves Zombies around running
• Plugins do not work
• Java™ has improved though it also does not work

operapluginwrapper: [plugin failed ] dlopen(RTLD_NOW | RTLD_GLOBAL) failed on /usr/mpkg/Acrobat5/Browsers/intellinux/nppdf.so
operapluginwrapper: [plugin failed ] With error /usr/mpkg/Acrobat5/Browsers/intellinux/nppdf.so: cannot enable executable stack as shared object requires: Permission denied

I wonder why. Adding a .note.GNU-stack section to the plugin did not help.
