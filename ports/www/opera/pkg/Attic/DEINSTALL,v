@Update Opera to 8.51, mostly from OpenBSD, but
* don't hardcode /usr/local, use $PREFIX
* don't write to /etc, it runs without the samples
* fix... etc.

It works, I can even install the Cocoa theme (but I prefer
the Minimalist Native one), but I can't read the menu text
(neither context menus), I only see empty squares.
