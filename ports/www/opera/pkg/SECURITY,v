@document why the Opera-Linux 9.50 update does not go live
(and probably won't)
@
text
@The tg-opera-9_5x branch in mircvs://ports/www/opera/ contains
a security update to Opera-Linux 9.50 (or above).  The version
used in the MAIN branch, Opera-Linux 9.27, is vulnerable.  The
update has not yet been committed to HEAD due to segfaults.
