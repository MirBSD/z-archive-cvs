@SECURITY upgrade to 9.24

@Opera is a fast and customizable WWW browser.  Features:
– HTML 4.01
– XML
– CSS1 and CSS2
– SVG 1.1 Basic
– HTTP 1.1
– 128-bit encryption, TLS 1.0, SSL 2 and 3
– ECMAScript, JavaScript 1.3
– tabbed browsing
– partial DOM and WAP/WML
– support for Netscape plug-ins
– fast rendering of pages
– extensive drag-and-drop features
– easy keyboard navigation and shortcuts and early implementation
  of Opera’s unique mouse gestures
– fast-forward function guessing most probable “next page” link
– multiple windows support
– resume interrupted download sessions
– high quality zooming; Opera can zoom in on a page up to 1000%
– a powerful search capability with the added possibility of searching
  the user’s own Hotlist
– Fraud protection
– adding custom search engines easily
– Site preferences
– built-in BitTorrent client
– password manager
– Content blocker
– Pop-Up blocker
– Widgets – small web applications that run inside the browser
– thumbnail preview for tabs
– “reload from cache” and local editing ability
– integration with the W3C validator (press Ctrl-Alt-V)
– Sessions
– quick preferences function
– Notes
– Voice control
– “trash can” for resurviving closed tabs and blocked pop-ups
– simple way to delete all private, session, history, etc. data
– built-in IRC and eMail client
– language packs – while the default Opera download comes with
  US-English only, a variety of languages are available on the
  Opera website (some of which are (about to be) packaged with
  this port) or third-party sites. This port adds:
  • Lëtzebuergsch
– customisable skins; this port comes with the two default skins and:
  • Minimalist Native
– instant toggling of image and documents settings
– full-screen and kiosk modes
– small-screen mode support to aid web developers
– “speed dial”
– developer tools available at http://dev.opera.com/tools/
– Voluntary, anonymous usage statistics reporting feature
– improved rich text editing functions
– transfer manager
– accessibility functionality, e.g. Zoom, user-controllable text
  sizes, colours and even CSS
– info panel

Issues:
– there is a soft dependency on redhat_motif
– opera 8 might segfault with your old opera 7 configuration, in that
  case remove ~/.opera and start over
– no SunJDK, IBMjava under MirOS BSD for now, since we can only run
  the sunjdk/jre-1.3 stuff in the linux emulation (currently, Java
  is disabled in the port, but may come back once requested, but
  then only with the sunjre-1.3-linux stuff)
– read the install notice (“pkg_info -D opera”) before using

@* untested update to 9.10
* bundle "Minimalist Native" theme (XXX can it be selected out of the box?)
* bundle .lu third-party language pack (the only language pack
  available for 9.10-Linux; the 9.10-Windows official packs won't
  work with the Linux binary; more to come...)

remaining issues:
* /etc/opera6rc can't be used, thus pkg/MESSAGE stays :(
* no Java support (someone should make 1.3-linux work)

@Update Opera to 8.51, mostly from OpenBSD, but
* don't hardcode /usr/local, use $PREFIX
* don't write to /etc, it runs without the samples
* fix... etc.

It works, I can even install the Cocoa theme (but I prefer
the Minimalist Native one), but I can't read the menu text
(neither context menus), I only see empty squares.
