@mod_log_sql offers Apache administrators the ability to log 
accesses to an SQL database. This capability can replace or 
coexist with Apache's regular text-file logging mechanisms. 
mod_log_sql is production-ready and is known to work with high 
volume webservers and webserver clusters supporting over six 
million hits per day (about 70 hits per second) -- and has 
been benchmarked at over 300 hits per second.
