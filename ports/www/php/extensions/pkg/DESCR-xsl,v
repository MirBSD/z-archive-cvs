@first step in upgrading php:
* mark as broken - upgrade in progress
* sync with OpenBSD
* update hardened-php patch version

note: we use php 5.0.5 not 5.1.2 like I would, because the
OpenBSD team has experienced problems with the 5.1 series,
and I don't want to dig deeper into that again

@XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) Transformations) is a
language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents.
It is a standard defined by The World Wide Web consortium (W3C).
Information about XSLT and related technologies can be found at
http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt.

This PHP extension provides a processor independent API to XSLT
transformations. Currently this extension only supports the Sablotron
library from the Ginger Alliance. Support is planned for other
libraries, such as the Xalan library or the libxslt library.
