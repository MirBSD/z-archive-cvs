@PHP supports libcurl, a library created by Daniel Stenberg, that
allows you to connect and communicate to many different types of
servers with many different types of protocols. libcurl currently
supports the http, https, ftp, gopher, telnet, dict, file, and ldap
protocols. libcurl also supports HTTPS certificates, HTTP POST,
HTTP PUT, FTP uploading (this can also be done with PHP's ftp
extension), HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, and user+password
authentication.
