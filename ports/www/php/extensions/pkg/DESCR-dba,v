@These functions build the foundation for accessing Berkeley DB style
databases.

This is a general abstraction layer for several file-based databases.
As such, functionality is limited to a common subset of features
supported by modern databases such as Sleepycat Software's DB2.
(This is not to be confused with IBM's DB2 software, which is
supported through the ODBC functions.)
