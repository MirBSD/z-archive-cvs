1.1
log
@first step in upgrading php:
* mark as broken - upgrade in progress
* sync with OpenBSD
* update hardened-php patch version

note: we use php 5.0.5 not 5.1.2 like I would, because the
OpenBSD team has experienced problems with the 5.1 series,
and I don't want to dig deeper into that again

@To completely deinstall the package you need to
perform these steps as root:

    edit ${WWW_PREFIX}/conf/httpd.conf
    remove the line LoadModule php5_module

Do not do this if you plan on re-installing php5
package at some future time.
