@many more distfile fixes:
either change stuff to let ‚Äúmmake checksum‚Äù succeed, for example by fixing
MASTER_SITES or DIST_SUBDIR, or by adding the ‚ÄúSize‚Äù That Does Matter‚Ñ¢ to
the distinfo (so that b0rken downloads are skipped), or by whatever other
means, or mark b0rken stuff as BROKEN for sure. For squid, I removed one
of the upstream patches from the list.

After this, all non-BROKEN (and some BROKEN and NOT_FOR_PLATFORM) distfiles
verify successfully (and thusly link to FTP/ and CDROM/ on the mirror).
