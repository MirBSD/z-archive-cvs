@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@+---------------
| This package uses the INSTANCE_HOME installation method, as described
| at http://www.zope.org/Members/4am/instancehome.  This allows you
| to install the Zope package once and create as many sites as you
| want without changing your core Zope installation.
|
| To create a Zope site, create a user and group to own it, create a
| directory for the site, and run
|
|	${PREFIX}/bin/zope-instance /path/to/site
|
| as the user who will own the site.
