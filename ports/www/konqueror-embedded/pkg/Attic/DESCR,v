@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@Stand-alone konqueror web-browser. Based on kde 2.2 source code.
Does not require kde2, only qt2.

- good javascript support, 
- https support, but does not show certificates,
- ftp support.

Still somewhat experimental, crashes.

See ${PREFIX}/bin/konq-e for cache/proxy support.

Flavors:
	kiosk - Build with the "Kiosk" GUI
