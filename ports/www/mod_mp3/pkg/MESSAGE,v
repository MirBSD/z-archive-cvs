@+---------------
| To finish the install of mod_mp3, you need
| to enable the module by using the following command
|
|   ${PREFIX}/sbin/mod_mp3-enable	
|
| Also, copy the following file into your Apache config
| directory:
|
|   ${PREFIX}/share/examples/mod_mp3/mp3.conf
|
| Add the following line to your httpd.conf:
|
|   include conf/mp3.conf
|
| Edit mp3.conf to suit your needs. 
|
| If you already have Apache running on your machine,
| you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
| you should fully stop and then restart the server.
