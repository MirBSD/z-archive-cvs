@mod_mp3 turns the Apache Web Server into an MP3 or Ogg streaming
server.  It can play from a list of files, either in order or
randomly.  It can also be used to cache MP3s into memory and have
the server operate entirely from memory.

Available flavours:
  mysql       - Fetch data from MySQL database.
  postgresql  - Fetch data from PostgreSQL database (alpha).
