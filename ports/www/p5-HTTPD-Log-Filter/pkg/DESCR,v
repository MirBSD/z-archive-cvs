@This module provide a simple interface to filter entries out of an httpd
logfile. The constructor can be passed regular expressions to match
against particular fields on the logfile.  It does its filtering line by
line, using a filter method that takes a line of a logfile as input, and
returns true if it matches, and false if it doesn't.
