@A class 1 and 2 DAV server for the Apache webserver

From http://www.webdav.org:

  "WebDAV stands for 'Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning'.
   It is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol which allows users to
   collaboratively edit and manage files on remote web servers."

DAV functionality includes creating, moving, copying, and deleting files
and directories on a remote web server. Utilizing DAV requires both a
DAV-aware client and server. mod_dav provides complete class 1 and 2 DAV
services to DAV clients via the Apache webserver (1.3.4 or later). The
number of DAV-aware clients is growing and includes the 'Web Folders' used
in Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 and Office 2000.
