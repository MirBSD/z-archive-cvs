@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@The Zope Content Management Framework provides a set of services
and content objects useful for building highly dynamic, content-oriented
portal sites.  As packaged, the CMF generates a site much like the
Zope.org site.  The CMF is intended to be easily customizable, in
terms of both the types of content used and the policies and services
it provides.
