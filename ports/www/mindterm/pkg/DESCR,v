@MindTerm is an implementation of a secure shell client in pure Java
supporting both the SSH1 and the SSH2 protocols.  MindTerm runs as a
standalone application as well as an Applet.  As an applet, MindTerm has
been tested with Netscape Communicator and Microsoft Internet Explorer
browsers.  As an application, MindTerm requires that a Java runtime
environment (JRE) be installed and should work with any 1.1.x runtime on
most platforms.
