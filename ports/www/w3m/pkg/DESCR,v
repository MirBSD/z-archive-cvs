@w3m (actually, WWWを見る (WWW-wo-Miru) not doubleu-three-em) is a
pager/text-based WWW browser. It is similar to Lynx, but it has
several features Lynx doesn't have:

* w3m can render tables
* w3m can render frames (by converting frames into tables)
* w3m can display documents from standard input
* w3m is small

Available flavours:
  image     - Support displaying inline images when run from an X11
              terminal emulator.
  japanese  - Provide Japanese menus and documentation, and properly
              display Japanese characters in kterm.
