@DB is a database abstraction layer providing:
* an OO-style query API
* portability features that make programs written for one DBMS
  work with other DBMSs
* a DSN (data source name) format for specifying database servers
* prepare/execute (bind) emulation for databases that don't
  support it natively
* a result object for each query response
* portable error codes
* sequence emulation
* sequential and non-sequential row fetching as well as bulk
  fetching
* formats fetched rows as associative arrays, ordered arrays or
  objects
* row limit support
* transactions support
* table information interface
* DocBook and PHPDoc API documentation

DB layers itself on top of PHP's existing database
extensions. The currently supported extensions are:
dbase, fbsql, interbase, informix, msql, mssql, mysql,
mysqli, oci8, odbc, pgsql, sqlite and sybase.

DB is compatible with both PHP 4 and PHP 5.
