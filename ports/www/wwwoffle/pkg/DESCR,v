dial-up internet links.  This means that it is possible to browse web pages and
read them without having to remain connected. 

Basic Features

    - Allows the 'GET', 'HEAD', 'POST' and 'PUT' HTTP methods.
    - Interactive or command line control of online/offline/autodial status.
    - Highly configurable.
    - Low maintenance, start/stop and online/offline status can be automated.
