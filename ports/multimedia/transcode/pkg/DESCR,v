@transcode is a text console video-stream processing tool.
It supports elementary video and audio frame transformations.
Some example modules are included to enable import of MPEG-1/2,
Digital Video, and other formats. It also includes export
modules for writing to AVI files with DivX, OpenDivX, XviD,
Digital Video or other codecs. Direct DVD transcoding is also
supported. A set of tools is available to extract and decode
the sources into raw video/audio streams for import and to
enable post-processing of AVI files.
