@remove by a (rather rude, I didn’t even read all of the eMail) upstream
request; no big loss for us, as this one’s currently broken anyway (does
not build nwcpp, so cannot generate any executables) and prior versions
produced bogus warnings and wrong code – way to go… (NOT!)

log
@• update to 0.7.8
  ‣ remove patches integrated into upstream
• fix compilation and installation
  ‣ installprefix is hard-coded into the resulting binaries, so it must
    not contain the fake prefix ⇒ install.sh needs DESTDIR support
  ‣ lib/dynlibnwcc.o was never installed
  ‣ symlinks were absolute instead of relative ⇒ broken
• fix upstream’s laziness
  (lots of compiler warnings)
• break, because nwcpp does not get built, so it has no usable cpp
  and refuses to compile even a hello world programme
