@kill LLVM+Clang and llvm-gcc ports; see transcript of #MirBSD on Freenode of today for details
if any, these may be resurrected build-depending on gcc… probably 4.8+, at least 4.7

note: gcc 4.4 “bootstrap-only” port is almost finished, as preliminary stage
(though we could choose 4.7 for that, too…)

1.1
log
@Clean up the port a little
• cut down un unneeded dependencies
• enable threads, workaround enough to make them build
• include some more basic mnbsd configuration
• overhaul mbsd configuration to more match mgcc from base
  (it’s unknown if this one were suitable for native code
  generation, but quite possible)
• enable DWARF2 unwinding (sjlj exceptions didn’t quite work)
• compile fixes for building this with llvm-gcc4.2 gnu99 itself (inlining…)

This compiler has produced a working lang/llvm package.
