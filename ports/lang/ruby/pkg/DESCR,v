@Ruby looks like a promising interpreted language.
It shamelessly borrows from perl. Even though 
there are differences, perl users will find it easy
to learn.

Some features:
- object oriented
- built-in threads and mutexes
- `mark and sweep' gc that makes it easy to add modules
- faster than perl
