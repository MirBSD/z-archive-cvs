@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially
