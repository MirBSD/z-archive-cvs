@The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) includes front ends for C, C++,
Objective-C, Objective-C++, Fortran, Java, and Ada, as well as
libraries for these languages (libobjc, libstdc++, libgcj,...).

GCC development is a part of the GNU Project and uses an open
development environment. Its supports many other platforms in
order to foster a world-class optimizing compiler, to attract a
larger team of developers, to ensure that GCC and the GNU system
work on multiple architectures and diverse environments, and to
more thoroughly test and extend the features of GCC.

This package contains the core C compiler and the C++ compiler,
for compiling packages that require some basic C++ support, such
as GCC 4.8 and later (which can then be used to bootstrap Clang
and even newer GCC versions).

This package contains the core C compiler, the C++ compiler, and
the Ada compiler suite (GNAT), for bootstrapping newer compilers
(both GCC and LLVM/Clang).

@broken experimental gcc4.4 port
• libtool 2.2, trouble replacing it with mirlibtool
• trouble regenerating some of the configure scripts

I give up but like to keep the work in VCS anyway
