@The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) includes front ends for C, C++,
Objective-C, Objective-C++, Fortran, Java, and Ada, as well as
libraries for these languages (libobjc, libstdc++, libgcj,...).

GCC development is a part of the GNU Project and uses an open
development environment. Its supports many other platforms in
order to foster a world-class optimizing compiler, to attract a
larger team of developers, to ensure that GCC and the GNU system
work on multiple architectures and diverse environments, and to
more thoroughly test and extend the features of GCC.

This package contains the shared runtime libraries.

@• merge with base gcc configuration
• enable shared libgcc, libobjc, …
• split off RTL DLLs into separate package, so that programmes built
  with this compiler don’t need to depend on it
