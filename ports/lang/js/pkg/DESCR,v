@The NGS JavaScript interpreter is an independent implementation of the 
JavaScript language, developed by Netscape et al. This implementation 
is designed to be re-entrant, extendible, fast, and programmable. 

This implementation is not 100% compatible with the JavaScript
language, found from the Netscape's WWW browsers and servers.  To
achieve the design goals, some shortcuts have been taken in the 
implementation, as compared to the Netscape's implementation.
