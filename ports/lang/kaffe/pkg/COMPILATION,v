@Initial revision

@Note: This port has built on a couple of machines loaded with OpenBSD 2.6.
It does not work on 2.5 or earlier. It sometimes works on machines
upgraded from 2.x to 2.6, but not always.
Sadly, the symptom is that you get all the way through compiling and then
fail to build with these errors:

Undefined symbol `_postOutOfMemory' referenced from text segment
Undefined symbol `_PtrClass' referenced from text segment

If you are getting these errors, please do not pester ports@@ or the
maintainer, but instead, install a full OpenBSD 2.6 distribution.
Or find and fix the problem.

Or use the prebuilt "package" on the FTP server. These are provided
for people that don't want to wrassle with compiling stuff.
