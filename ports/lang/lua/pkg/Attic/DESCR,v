@Lua is a powerful, light-weight programming language designed for
extending applications. Lua is also frequently used as a general-purpose,
stand-alone language.

Lua combines simple procedural syntax (similar to Pascal) with
powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays
and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, interpreted
from bytecodes, and has automatic memory management with garbage
collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid
prototyping.

A fundamental concept in the design of Lua is to provide meta-mechanisms
for implementing features, instead of providing a host of features
directly in the language. For example, although Lua is not a pure
object-oriented language, it does provide meta-mechanisms for
implementing classes and inheritance. Lua's meta-mechanisms bring
an economy of concepts and keep the language small, while allowing
the semantics to be extended in unconventional ways. Extensible
semantics is a distinguishing feature of Lua.

Lua is a language engine that you can embed into your application.
This means that, besides syntax and semantics, Lua has an API that
allows the application to exchange data with Lua programs and also
to extend Lua with C functions. In this sense, Lua can be regarded
as a language framework for building domain-specific languages.

Lua is implemented as a small library of C functions, written in
ANSI C, and compiles unmodified in all known platforms. The
implementation goals are simplicity, efficiency, portability, and
low embedding cost. The result is a fast language engine with small
footprint, making it ideal in embedded systems too.

Lua was designed and implemented at TeCGraf, the Computer Graphics
Technology Group of PUC-Rio (the Pontifical Catholic University of
Rio de Janeiro in Brazil). TeCGraf is a laboratory of the Department
of Computer Science. The authors can be contacted by email at
