@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@tentatively build this on MirOS using an OpenBSD native
jdk1.4 (also from the truk port) whom I added a
MirBSD_i386.properties file manually before build

didn't test yet, didn't even try a linux-initiated build;
building from obsd needs NO_SYSTRACE=yes (and a dependency
and ALT_BOOTDIR change) which is not part of this Makefile
I committed.

this port SHOULD work as well under OpenBSD, where you
(apparently) CAN do a linux-initiated build
