@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@The 1.2pre-v2 release of the Blackdown JDK is based on Sun's JDK
1.2.  (As of 29 December 2000, Sun is distributing JDK 1.2.2.)  As
such, it is subject to several security vulnerabilities that we
cannot correct.  More information on those as well as other known
Java vulnerabilities can be found at
