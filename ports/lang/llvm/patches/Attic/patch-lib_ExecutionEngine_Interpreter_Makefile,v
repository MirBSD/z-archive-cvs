@kill LLVM+Clang and llvm-gcc ports; see transcript of #MirBSD on Freenode of today for details
if any, these may be resurrected build-depending on gcc… probably 4.8+, at least 4.7

note: gcc 4.4 “bootstrap-only” port is almost finished, as preliminary stage
(though we could choose 4.7 for that, too…)

@this is as far as I, bugged by nosy ciruZ who wants me to do some ObjC,
get for tonight. it is no fun, we need to find a clang version which fits
better to llvm 2.4 than the one I picked up… or switch to llvm-current…

… then too, this is a PITA to get compiled… I’m not any more too sure
about all of this… C++--
