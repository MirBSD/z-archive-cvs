1.1
log
@downgrade to 1.4.9, a version I had lying around anyway; this one still
uses autoconf-2.61 upstream (1.4.13 uses autoconf-2.63b (!) which is
EVEN NEWER than autoconf-2.63, so we couldn’t even have done this trick
with it…) and regenerate its configure script, so that we can still, as
per bsiegert@@’s fix, use CONFIGURE_STYLE=gnu on all platforms; however,
AUTOCONF_NEW=Yes is still required so that configure gets passed correct
arguments

this shall be enough until such time as m4-1.4.13 (or whatever version
will be current by then) can be ported using autoconf-2.65 pregenerated
configure script diffs like here

according to autoconf-2.63 docs, GNU m4 1.4.5 is required (even though
version 1.4.11 or later is recommended), let’s see how this plays with
autoconf-2.65… (but first we need to clear up that mess that the auto-
conf ports are)

text
@GNU 'm4' is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro processor.
It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some extensions (for
example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to macros). GNU
'm4' also has builtin functions for including files, running shell
commands, doing arithmetic, etc. GNU Bison needs GNU 'm4' to properly
operate. GNU Autoconf needs GNU 'm4' for generating 'configure'
scripts, but not for running them.
