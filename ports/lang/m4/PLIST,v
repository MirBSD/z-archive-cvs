1.1
log
@downgrade to 1.4.9, a version I had lying around anyway; this one still
uses autoconf-2.61 upstream (1.4.13 uses autoconf-2.63b (!) which is
EVEN NEWER than autoconf-2.63, so we couldn’t even have done this trick
with it…) and regenerate its configure script, so that we can still, as
per bsiegert@@’s fix, use CONFIGURE_STYLE=gnu on all platforms; however,
AUTOCONF_NEW=Yes is still required so that configure gets passed correct
arguments

this shall be enough until such time as m4-1.4.13 (or whatever version
will be current by then) can be ported using autoconf-2.65 pregenerated
configure script diffs like here

according to autoconf-2.63 docs, GNU m4 1.4.5 is required (even though
version 1.4.11 or later is recommended), let’s see how this plays with
autoconf-2.65… (but first we need to clear up that mess that the auto-
conf ports are)
