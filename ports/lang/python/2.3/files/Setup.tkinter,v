1.2
log
@Preliminary commit, to be ok'd by bsiegert@@ later
* remove Python 2.1
* remove Python 2.2
* make the Python 2.3 Makefile easier by shoving stuff into Makefile.inc
* sync patch-configure_in with OpenBSD
  + cc -shared for a.out platforms on 3.8+
  + support for 3.7, 3.8
* add RCS IDs to all patches/files
* sync port and Makefile.inc better against OpenBSD
* sort flavours
* sort Makefile.inc order
* no_cxx flavour now implies _all_ other no_* (missed expat)
* use ${PICFLAG} not -fPIC (invalid on e.g. Darwin, Interix)
* by default, still pull in only the no_cxx flavour as a dependency
  XXX should make no-no_cxx match no_cxx dependency
* XXX update to 2.3.5 missing, will commit that (and 2.4) later
  after this is ok'd by bsiegert@@

untested, WIP
