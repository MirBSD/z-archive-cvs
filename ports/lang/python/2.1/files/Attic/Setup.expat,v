1.2
log
@Preliminary commit, to be ok'd by bsiegert@@ later
* remove Python 2.1
* remove Python 2.2
* make the Python 2.3 Makefile easier by shoving stuff into Makefile.inc
* sync patch-configure_in with OpenBSD
  + cc -shared for a.out platforms on 3.8+
  + support for 3.7, 3.8
* add RCS IDs to all patches/files
* sync port and Makefile.inc better against OpenBSD
* sort flavours
* sort Makefile.inc order
* no_cxx flavour now implies _all_ other no_* (missed expat)
* use ${PICFLAG} not -fPIC (invalid on e.g. Darwin, Interix)
* by default, still pull in only the no_cxx flavour as a dependency
  XXX should make no-no_cxx match no_cxx dependency
* XXX update to 2.3.5 missing, will commit that (and 2.4) later
  after this is ok'd by bsiegert@@

untested, WIP

# Interface to the Expat XML parser
#
# Expat is written by James Clark and must be downloaded separately
# (see below).  The pyexpat module was written by Paul Prescod after a
# prototype by Jack Jansen.
#
# The Expat dist includes Windows .lib and .dll files.  Home page is at
# http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html, the current production release is
# always ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/xml/expat.zip.
#
# EXPAT_DIR, below, should point to the expat/ directory created by
# unpacking the Expat source distribution.
#
# Note: the expat build process doesn't yet build a libexpat.a; you can
# do this manually while we try convince the author to add it.  To do so,
# cd to EXPAT_DIR, run "make" if you have not done so, then run:
#
#    ar cr libexpat.a xmltok/*.o xmlparse/*.o
