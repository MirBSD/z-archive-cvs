@drop (non-free) sqlite support; fix some regression tests
@
text
@As required by item 3 of the PSF license, here is a brief summary
of changes made to this version of Python for the MirPorts framework.

More detailed changes at http://cvs.mirbsd.de/ports/lang/python/

 * Support for MirBSD and ekkoBSD unames was added in the configure
   script.
 * The GNU libreadline port is pulled in.
 * NIS is disabled on MirOS.
 * In the configure script, the tests for MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET have
   been properly quoted, and the build always uses an empty (i.e.
   default) deployment target.
 * Fix Issue #9075
 * We use db1.85 from libc and do not use SQLite (which is non-free).
 * Regression tests have been taught about MirBSD. (Mostly.)

The following changes have been made by OpenBSD:

 * tempfile.py was patched to not try /usr/tmp as a possible
   tempfile directory.
 * OpenBSD threads are used for threading support.
 * The interpreter is called "python2.5" in order to support multiple
   versions of Python coexisting on the same system.  If no "python"
   binary exists, a symlink to "python2.5" is created when package
   is installed.
 * Regression tests have been taught about OpenBSD.

@Make this actually usable on Darwin by installing unstripped binaries.
Also quote the tests for MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET, which may be empty,
and drop support for old (<10.3) Mac OS versions. Bump 2.5 patchlevel.

1.4
log
@• update to the latest 2.5 series Python
• cope for possible hidden dependency on ncursesw
• mark as NOT_FOR_PLATFORM Darwin, because both anakin and jajabings
  are not powered on right now, so I cannot sync PFRAG.dylib, and this
  way we can avoid needing to bump DASH_VER upon doing so (just remove
  the NOT_FOR_PLATFORM clause, commit Makefile and PFRAG.dylib at once)
• make dbhash usable with bsddb185 module ipv bsddb module (gebi@@grml.org)
• make gdbm usable, it’s pulled in anyway if installed, and in py3k there
  will be no bsddb[185] any more anyway (gebi@@grml.org)
• ensure IPv6 is not forcibly enabled on Interix
• add PATCHLEVEL to SUBST_VARS (for egg info)

1.3
log
@* remove obsolete ffi patches, now that we use system ffi
* link to CVSweb in changelog
* chmod u+w before ranlibbing
* use -D_ALL_SOURCE on MirBSD #10 and up (to #99 ;)
* fix shlibs for MidnightBSD
* never pick up /usr/local/{include,lib} - this might be dangerous
  (e.g. wrong libintl on mnbsd) and is not controlled by MirPorts
  but not considered part of the base system either
* never pick up a Berkeley/Sleepycat/Oracle DB3 or DB4, because,
  if it's detected, the bsddb185 module is not built automatically
* bump dashver

log
@SECURITY: Apply security patches for CVE-2008-2315, CVE-2008-2316 and some
"misc fixes". From Gentoo. Upstream's patch does not apply on their 2.5
branch, of course, only in the trunk. Sigh.

Merge CHANGES.MirPorts with CHANGES.OpenBSD while here.

@New python 2.5 port, still experimental. Contains security fixes that are
no longer applied to the unmaintained 2.3 series.

As MirPorts is a derivative from the OpenBSD ports tree, you will find
OpenBSD's changes in the file CHANGES.OpenBSD in the same directory as
this file.
