1.2
log
@Preliminary commit, to be ok'd by bsiegert@@ later
* remove Python 2.1
* remove Python 2.2
* make the Python 2.3 Makefile easier by shoving stuff into Makefile.inc
* sync patch-configure_in with OpenBSD
  + cc -shared for a.out platforms on 3.8+
  + support for 3.7, 3.8
* add RCS IDs to all patches/files
* sync port and Makefile.inc better against OpenBSD
* sort flavours
* sort Makefile.inc order
* no_cxx flavour now implies _all_ other no_* (missed expat)
* use ${PICFLAG} not -fPIC (invalid on e.g. Darwin, Interix)
* by default, still pull in only the no_cxx flavour as a dependency
  XXX should make no-no_cxx match no_cxx dependency
* XXX update to 2.3.5 missing, will commit that (and 2.4) later
  after this is ok'd by bsiegert@@

untested, WIP

@$MirOS: ports/lang/python/2.2/files/CHANGES.OpenBSD,v 1.1 2005/03/18 15:55:47 tg Exp $

As required by item 3 of the PSF license, here is a brief summary
of changes made to this version of Python for the OpenBSD package.

1.  tempfile.py was patched to not try /usr/tmp as a possible
    tempfile directory.

2.  libpython is created as a shared library, and the pthread stack
    size was doubled to support this with complex applications such
    as Zope.

3.  OpenBSD threads are used for threading support.

4.  The interpreter is called "python2.1" in order to support multiple
    versions of Python coexisting on the same system.  If no "python"
    binary exists, a symlink to "python2.1" is created when package
    is installed.
    Same process applies to IDLE binary (idle) and pydoc.

5.  Regression tests have been taught about OpenBSD.

These changes are available in the OpenBSD CVS repository
<http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html> in ports/lang/python.
