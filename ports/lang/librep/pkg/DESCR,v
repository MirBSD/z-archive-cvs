@This is a lightweight Lisp environment for UNIX. It contains a Lisp
interpreter, byte-code compiler and virtual machine. Applications may
use the Lisp interpreter as an extension language, or it may be used
for standalone scripts.

Originally inspired by Emacs Lisp, the language dialect combines many
of the elisp features while trying to remove some of the main
deficiencies, with features from Common Lisp and Scheme.
