@GUILE, GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extension,
is a library that implements the Scheme language plus various
convenient facilities. It's designed so that you can link it
into an application or utility to make it extensible.  Our
plan is to link this library into all GNU programs that call for 
extensibility.
