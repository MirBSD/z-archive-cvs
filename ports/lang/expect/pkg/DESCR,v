@Expect is a program that performs programmed dialogue with other
interactive programs.  It is briefly described by its man page, expect(1).

It uses pseudo-tty's to control the child processes, so it is not affected
by programs that refuse to read from stdin or pipes. (eg: passwd(1) etc).

Flavours:
	no_tk - Do not build with Tk support.
