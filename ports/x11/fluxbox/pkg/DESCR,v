@Fluxbox is yet another window manager for X. It's based on the
original Blackbox 0.61.1 code. Fluxbox looks like Blackbox and
handles styles, colors, window placement and similar things i
exactly like Blackbox (100% theme/style compatibility). 

So what's the difference between Fluxbox and Blackbox then? The
answer is: LOTS!
