@TkTable is a table/matrix widget extension to Tcl/Tk.
The basic features of the widget are:

 * multi-line cells
 * support for embedded windows (one per cell)
 * row & column spanning
 * variable width columns / height rows (interactively resizable)
 * row and column titles
 * multiple data sources ((Tcl array || Tcl command) &| internal caching)
 * supports standard Tk reliefs, fonts, colors, etc.
 * x/y scrollbar support
 * 'tag' styles per row, column or cell to change visual appearance
 * in-cell editing - returns value back to data source
 * support for disabled (read-only) tables or cells (via tags)
 * multiple selection modes, with "active" cell
 * multiple drawing modes to get optimal performance for larger tables
 * optional 'flashes' when things update
 * cell validation support
 * Works everywhere Tk does (including Windows and Mac!)
 * Unicode support (Tk8.1+)
