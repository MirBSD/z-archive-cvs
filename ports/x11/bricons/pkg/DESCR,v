@       Bricons program allows the user to quickly start up appli-
       cations by selecting the appropriate button from the  dis-
       play  and pressing the left mouse button.  A maximum of up
       to sixteen main menu buttons can be displayed.  Each  main
       menu button can launch an application or pop-up a sub menu
       containing more buttons. The buttons can be represented as
       a bitmap, text or a colour icon (i.e Pixmap).
