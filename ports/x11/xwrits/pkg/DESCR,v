@Xwrits reminds you to take wrist breaks for prevention or management
of repetitive stress injuries.  When you should take a break, it
pops up an X window, the warning window.  You click on the warning
window, then take a break.  The window changes appearance while you
take the break.  It changes again when your break is over.  Then
you just resume typing.  Xwrits hides itself until you should take
another break.
