@xcoloredit provides a graphical method of mixing the three primary
colors available on a colour workstation. This mixing can be done
using the Red, Green and Blue slider controls on the left of the
window or using the Hue, Satu- ration and Value slider controls on the
right.

Note that xcoloredit does not work on 16/24 bits display.
