@add a new font as requested by Ypnose (its author) on IRC

@Envypn is a pcf font inspired by Envy Code R.
I wanted to have a highly readable pcf font.
I started this font from scratch!
It's called Envypn because it's a mix of Envy and Ypnose.
Many symbols are redrawed and improved.
I didn't copied letters from Envy Code R.
