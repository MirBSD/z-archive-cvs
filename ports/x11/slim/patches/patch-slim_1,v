1.1
log
@New port for slim, a simple login manager for X. From OpenBSD, but Makefile
rewritten in bsd.prog.mk. DESCR:

SLiM is a Desktop-independent graphical login manager for X11,
derived from Login.app.
It aims to be light and simple, although completely configurable
through themes and an option file. It is suitable for machines on
which remote login functionalities are not needed.
