@New port for slim, a simple login manager for X. From OpenBSD, but Makefile
rewritten in bsd.prog.mk. DESCR:

SLiM is a Desktop-independent graphical login manager for X11,
derived from Login.app.
It aims to be light and simple, although completely configurable
through themes and an option file. It is suitable for machines on
which remote login functionalities are not needed.

Slim can be started at boot time by adding the following to
/etc/rc.local:

if [ -x ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/slim ]; then
        echo -n ' slim'; ( sleep 5; ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/slim -d ) &
fi

The sleep 5 is here to be sure tty flags are correctly set, you can try
to directly run ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/slim -d instead.

On i386, amd64 and VGA-based alpha, slim is launched on vt05 like xdm.

If you're on a zaurus you'll have to change this setting to vt01 in
${SYSCONFDIR}/slim.conf.

If you're on an arch which doesn't handle virtual terminals (like
macppc, sparc, sparc64, TGA-based alpha, hp300 or vax), you will have to
explicitely set getty off on ttyC0 in /etc/ttys to avoid input
conflicts:

ttyC0 "/usr/libexec/getty Pc" vt220 off secure
