@XDaliClock is for the X Window System. It can display in 12 or 24
hour modes, and displays the date when a mouse button is held down.
It has four large fonts built into it, but it can animate most other
fonts that contain all of the digits. It can also do some funky
psychedelic colormap cycling, and can use overlay planes or the
`shape' extension so that the window is transparent.
