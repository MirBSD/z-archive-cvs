@Initial revision

@Blackbox is yet another addition to the list of window managers for
the X Consortium's X Windowing System Version 11 Release 6. Blackbox
is built with C++, sharing no common code with any other window
manager (even though the graphics implementation is similar to that
of WindowMaker). It features small code size, a fast interface with
simple menus, multiple workspaces, and decorated windows , built-in
graphics code to render solids, gradients and bevels on the fly
when needed, and more.
