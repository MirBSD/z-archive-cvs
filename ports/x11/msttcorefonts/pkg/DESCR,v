@Initial revision

@The TrueType core fonts for the web that were once available from
http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/. The port is constructed
so that the actual fonts are downloaded from Sourceforge's site at
build time so this port does not 'redistribute' the fonts, it just
makes it easy to install them on an OpenBSD system.
