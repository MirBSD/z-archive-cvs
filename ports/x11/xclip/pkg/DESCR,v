@xclip is a command line utility that is designed to run on any system
with an X11 implementation.  It provides an interface to X selections
("the clipboard") from the command line.  It can read data from standard
in or a file and place it in an X selection for pasting into other X
applications.  xclip can also print an X selection to standard out,
which can then be redirected to a file or another program.
