@Xtacy, a Graphics Hack for X11 windows
--------------------------------------

"Wow! This is better than snorting caffeine!"  --Neil Braun

Xtacy is a graphics hack which I've been, well, hacking on, for 2 or 3
years now. It's been compiled on DECstations 3100, SGI running IRIX 5.3, 
and Linux boxen. I think someone got it running on a Sun once, but it 
had problems with the circle draw function, so a couple of the modes 
looked quite odd. Not that odd is bad. Just odd.

So what does it do? Xtacy displays bouncing shapes, rotating palettes, 
a couple fractals, a kaleidoscope, and lots of more stuff.
