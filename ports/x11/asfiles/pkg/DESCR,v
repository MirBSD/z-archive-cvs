@This is a hack to OffiX Files-2.4e to make it look like the NeXT
file manager.  The icons are now pretty.

It provides virtually all of the features that you would expect in
a file manager -- move around your directory tree in multiple
windows, move, copy or delete files, and launch programs with simple
mouse operations.

It is dockable provided you use Window Maker.
