| In order to use qvwm as your window manager, you must change your
| .xinitrc or .xsession appropriately and add a line similar to the
| following:
|
| 	exec ${PREFIX}/bin/qvwm
|
| The default configuration and icons are stored in ${PREFIX}/share/qvwm.
| To use your own configuration, copy ${PREFIX}/share/qvwm/system.qvwmrc to
