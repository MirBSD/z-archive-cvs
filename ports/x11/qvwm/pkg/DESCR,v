@Qvwm is a Windows 95/98/NT like window manager for X Window System.  It allows 
Windows 95/98/NT users to use X Window System without hesitation and X Window 
System users to use Windows 95/98/NT without hesitation. 

The name qvwm derives from the following: 'q' stands for '9'(same pronunciation 
in Japanese and almost the same shape) and 'v' for '5'(V is 5 in Roman numerals)
Also, qvwm is "98 Window Manager" because 'v' stands for '8'(vertically flipped,
V is similar to 8 in kanji characters). 

Features:

	* Written with C++ from scratch. 
	* Internationalized without patches. 
        * The same graphics with Windows 95 at a pixel level. 
        * Enables the user to switch among windows using the task switcher. 
          (Alt+Tab) 
        * Enables the user to make some windows taskbar indicators. 
        * Enables the user to move and resize a whole window. (full-drag) 
        * Virtual screen. (extension of Windows 95) 
        * Dialog box on termination. 
        * Titlebar animation on minimizing/maximizing a window.
