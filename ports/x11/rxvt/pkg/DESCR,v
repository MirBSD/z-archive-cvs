@Initial revision

text
@Rxvt is an xterm replacement which uses a little less memory, and is 
suitable for use on machines with small memories. Tek4010 support
is removed.

Modifications were made by Rob Nation (nation@@rocket.sanders.lockheed.com) 
to make it a little more compact, and to add and remove certain features.
