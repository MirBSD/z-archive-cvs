@This package provides four sample theme engines for GTK+:

 Pixmap: A generic engine that renders using pixmaps.
   One theme using this theme engine is included.

 Metal: A fairly complete theme engine that looks like the
   Java-Metal look of Swing.

 Redmond95: A simple theme engine that looks a bit like 
   Microsoft Windows95.

 Notif: A simple Motif-look-alike theme
