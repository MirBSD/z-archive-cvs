--------------------------- Original README -------------------------------
Xfedor is a bdf/xbm/xpm/mouse editor.
It has been achieved before Xt or Motif were available, so it is only 
based on Xlib :-|

Known problems:
      - very very old proprietary/personal:-) look&feelsick
      - C comments in french
      - filer.c module (BDF reader/writer) has to be reviewed for new BDF
        stuff and some bugs (COMMENT lines lost, unexpected changes in
	read/write only actions...) 
      - non Xt based => icccm problems, fixed geometry, lack of resources...
      - not even X based originally, so don't expect something great.
        (visual problem I would say on weird X server).

Otherwise, it can still help to create mouse cursors, colored pixmaps and
possibly fonts (if you don't care about XLFD compliance...).

Xfedor needs the Xpm library to link.
