@xfce4-fsguard-plugin checks the chosen mountpoint for free disk space.
It displays 4 different icons (red, yellow, green, unknown) and a
message box, depending on the free space.  The amount of free disk space
is visible in a tooltip.  If you left-click on its icon, it opens the
mountpoint directory in the file manager.
