@# $OpenBSD: Makefile,v 1.3 2004/01/09 01:27:43 jolan Exp $

COMMENT=			settings management library used by most xfce4 modules
DISTNAME=	libxfce4mcs-${VSN}

LIB_DEPENDS=	${GLIB2} \

USE_X11=	Yes

log
@Correct USE_X11 use.

NOTE: Setting USE_X11?=Yes in a Makefile.inc has no effect because it
will only be included after the MirPorts system Makefiles, so the
USE_X11?=No there will prevail.
