@XGlobe displays the earth as seen from space on your X desktop, similar 
to xearth by Kirk Lauritz Johnson. 
The image of the globe is updated at regular intervals. 
XGlobe uses a world map image which is mapped to the globe.
With a good map this can look very nice.
It is possible to mark locations on the globe.

As a bonus, this package includes an `OpenBSD markers' file, which collates
the location of many major developers and other people from the OpenBSD
community.

${HOMEPAGE} points to a fairly extensive collection of maps.
