@Ladies and gentlemen, I present you the first working port using svn distfiles:

@FLTK (pronounced "fulltick") is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for
X11, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS X. FLTK provides modern GUI
functionality without the bloat and supports 3D graphics via OpenGL and
its built-in GLUT emulation.

FLTK is designed to be small and modular enough to be statically linked,
but works fine as a shared library. FLTK also includes an excellent UI
builder called FLUID that can be used to create applications in minutes.
