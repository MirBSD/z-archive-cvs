1.1
log
@add a port for 915resolution, mostly from OpenBSD, but made more nice

now I just need the eeepc from yesterday to check if it now worksâ€¦
@
text
@This software changes the resolution of an available vbios mode. It
patches only the RAM version of the video bios so the new resolution is
lost each time you reboot.

Because 915resolution requires write access to /dev/mem, the system must be
at a securelevel <= 0.
