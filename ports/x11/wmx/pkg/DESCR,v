@wmx is another window manager for X.  It is based on wm2 and provides
a similarly unusual style of window decoration; but in place of wm2's
minimal functionality, it offers many of the features of more
conventional managers in the most simplistic implementations
imaginable.  wmx is, however, still not configurable except by editing
the source and recompiling the code.
