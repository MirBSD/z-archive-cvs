@A minimalist window manager for the X Window System.

'Minimalist'  here  doesn't mean it's too bare to be usable - it
just means it omits a lot of the stuff that make other window
managers unusable. Here is a list of features:
 * No window decorations apart from a simple 1 pixel border.
 * No icons.
 * Good keyboard control, including repositioning and maximise toggles.
 * Solid window drags (compile time option - may be slow on old machines).
 * Snap-to-border support (command line option).
 * Virtual desktops (compile time option).
 * Small binary size (even with everything turned on).

Available flavours:

 * miros (default)
	Instead of using upstream evilwm and patching it,
	pull mirvilwm from CVS and build that, with no
	changes, yielding the same as in MirOS X11-base.
 * oldmove
	Starting with evilwm 0.99.14, the "new move
	behaviour" is to only move a window if you move
	it by 5 or more pixels. This can be rather
	annoying, even if moving a window by accident.
	This flavour reverts to the older move behaviour.

This port differs from the in-tree evilwm of MirOS-current in that
it does not restore the old, pre-evilwm-0.99.14, move behaviour.

 * unpatched
	This flavour yields a pristine evilem without MirOS
	patches or changed functionality.

	This flavour restores the old move behaviour, thus
	yielding the same evilwm as contained in MirOS xbase.
