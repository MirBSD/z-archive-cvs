@xwit ("x window interface tool") is a hodge-podge collection of
simple routines to call some of those X11 functions that don't
already have any utility commands built around them.  The reasoning
behind this is that loosely every X function should be accessible
from a shell script.

For example, XWarpPointer() will move the X pointer, but no utility
program exists to do so on those rare occasions when you could
really use it.  xwit will also resize, iconify, pop, and move windows
given by name or id, change an icon, title or name, set the screen
saver going, and change individual key autorepeat settings, etc.
