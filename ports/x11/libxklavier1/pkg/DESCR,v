@libxklavier is a library providing a high-level API for the X Keyboard
Extension (XKB). This library is intended to support XFree86 and other
commercial X servers. It is useful for creating XKB-related software
(layout indicators etc). 

The current features are: 

* Reading XKB configuration registry information (for XFree86) 
* Configuring XKB 
* Application-defined callbacks for many XKB-related events 
* Support for per-window switching etc.
