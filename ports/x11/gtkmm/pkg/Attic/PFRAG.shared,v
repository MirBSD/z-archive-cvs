@fix the dependencies for gtkmm, which was broken since, uh, long;
still doesn't build, but there is only so much C++ troubles a man
can bear, and I had my share for >6 weeks in just the last waking
period... (gtkmm is required by gjdict, which I marked BROKEN too
so it doesn't disturb bulk builds... it requries more, but...)
