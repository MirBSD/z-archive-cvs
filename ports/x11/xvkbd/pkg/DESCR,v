@xvkbd is a virtual (graphical) keyboard program for X Window System
which provides facility to enter characters onto other clients
(softwares) by clicking on a keyboard displayed on the screen.  This
may be used for systems without a hardware keyboard such as kiosk
terminals or handheld devices.  This program also has facility to
send characters specified as the command line option to another client.
