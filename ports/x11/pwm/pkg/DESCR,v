@PWM is a lightweight window manager for X11 with emphasis on usability.
It was the first window manager to implement "tabbed frames". This
feature helps keeping windows, especially the numerous xterms,
organized.

PWM has a clean and simple look inspired by BeOS and Motif. It does have
workspaces, menus and Window Maker dockapp support as well as good
keyboard support and almost all the functionality is configurable.

It does not have all the features (such as pixmapped themes, icons,
iconified windows or titlebar buttons) that one might expect from a
typical window manager and may not be the easiest one to get into.
