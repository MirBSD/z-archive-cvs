@The librsvg library is a lightweight library for parsing and rendering
vector-graphic files in SVG format (like the ones made by sodipodi). It also
includes functions that render anti-aliased fonts using freetype, including
caching of glyphs. It's used by Nautilus for drawing vector icons and
anti-aliased type.
