@Update evolution-data-server to 1.10.2-0 and unbreak it. Wow, this was
a lot of work.

Network timeouts in the Groupwise and Exchange backends are likely to be
broken. I filed a bug report (#451003) in GNOME bugzilla. I also did a
half-assed attempt to convert the build to BSD make but it still requires
gmake.
