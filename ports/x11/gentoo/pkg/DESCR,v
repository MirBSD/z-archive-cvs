@Initial revision

@gentoo is a modern, powerful, flexible, and utterly configurable file 
manager for UNIX systems, written using the GTK+ toolkit. It aims 
to be 100% graphically configurable; there's no need to edit config 
files by hand and then restart the application. gentoo is somewhat 
inspired in its look & feel by the classic Amiga program DirectoryOpus.
