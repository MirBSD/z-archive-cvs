@Bg5pdf is a simple wrapper for wrapping big5 encoding text file into
PDF file by using PDFlib. The output of this program does not contain
embedding fonts.  You have to download Acrobat Acroread Asianfont pack
to view and print the output file.  This wrapper does not provide any
formatting function except simple line wrapping.  If you need
sophisticated formatting, you should try CJK-LaTex or other equivalent
tools.
