@Gaim is a GTK+-based multi-protocol instant messaging client. It
is compatible with AIM, ICQ, MSN Messenger, Yahoo, IRC, Jabber,
Gadu-Gadu, Novell GroupWise, and Zephyr networks.

Gaim supports many features of the various networks, such as file
transfer, away messages, typing notification, and MSN window closing
notification. It also goes beyond that and provides many unique
features. A few popular features are Buddy Pounces, which give the
ability to notify you, send a message, play a sound, or run a program
when a specific buddy goes away, signs online, or returns from idle;
and plugins, consisting of text replacement, a buddy ticker, extended
message notification, iconify on away, and more.

Gaim integrates well with GNOME and KDE's system trays.  This allows
you to work with Gaim without requiring the buddy list window to
be up at all times.

Gaim is under constant development, and releases are usually frequent.
