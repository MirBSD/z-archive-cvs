1.2
log
@Update to 0.43. From (fixed) DESCR:

Net::Daemon is an abstract base class for implementing portable server
applications in a very simple way.
It offers methods for the most common tasks a daemon
needs: Starting up, logging, accepting clients, authorization,
restricting its own environment for security and doing the true work.
You only have to override those methods that aren't appropriate for you,
but typically inheriting will save you a lot of work anyway.
