@spelling cleanup: “programme” is distinct from “program”; even in
British English, the latter is used for computer programs, while
the former serves for things like the TV programme, or a programme
to plant trees

@djbdns is a collection of Domain Name System tools. It includes
several components:

• The dnscache program is a local DNS cache. It accepts recursive
  DNS queries from local clients such as web browsers. It collects
  responses from remote DNS servers.
• The tinydns program is a fast, UDP-only DNS server. It makes local
  DNS information available to the Internet.
• The pickdns program is a load-balancing DNS server. It points
  clients to a dynamic selection of IP addresses.
• The walldns program is a reverse DNS wall. It provides matching
  reverse and forward records while hiding local host information.
• The rbldns program is an IP-address-listing DNS server. It uses DNS
  to publish a list of IP addresses, such as RBL or DUL.
• The dns library handles outgoing and incoming DNS packets. It can
  be used by clients such as web browsers to look up host addresses,
  host names, MX records, etc. It supports asynchronous resolution.
• The dnsfilter program is a parallel IP-address-to-host-name converter.
• The dnsip, dnsipq, dnsname, dnstxt, and dnsmx programs are simple
  command-line interfaces to DNS.
• The dnsquery and dnstrace programs are DNS debugging tools.
• The dnscache-conf program sets up dnscache to work at once with
  root servers from ${FLAVOURS}
• The axfrdns program can be used to exchange data with BIND servers.
  It is capable of AXFR and IXFR protocols.
• dnscache can "ban" specified A and AAAA records from being returned,
  rendering domains/hosts which resolve to these unusable, returning
  NXDOMAIN. This can be used to "ban" wildcard second-level domains,
  such as those used by Verisign Corp.
• This version has been extensibly patched to enable coexisting IPv4
  and IPv6 transports and connect to nameservers using either protocol
  and, courtesy of Fefe, allows listening on multiple addresses at once.
• Several IPv6-related bugs and Fefe's shortcomings have been fixed, on
  top of djbdns-1.05-test27.diff.bz2 plus other patches.
• SRV records are supported… somewhat.
• 0.0.0.0 is no longer parsed as [::] but as [::FFFF:0.0.0.0] ☺
• The patch to merge identical outgoing requests, and the patch to
  allow caching SOA responses, from http://www.your.org/dnscache/
  have been merged.
• For IPv6 reverse DNS, only the ip6.arpa. domain is used.

@complete overhaul of djbdns port:

• merge t4/t6 flavours back into one binary
  ‣ greatly simplify IPv6 handling, too; drop code for v6-less OSes
• merge v4/v6 dnsroots back into one, update all of them
• improve documentation a bit
• apply two patches from http://www.your.org/dnscache/ (SECURITY):
  ‣ merge identical outgoing requests
  ‣ allow caching SOA responses
• update to Fefe’s djbdns-1.05-test27.diff.bz2
  ‣ fixes recursively resolving hosts behind IPv6-only nameservers;
    spotted by Natureshadow (for Teckids’ Lunatics network) and via
    http://serverfault.com/q/627912/189656 (which I’ll answer RSN)
  ⚠ fix with “one second” CDB validity patch
  ⚠ adapt for OpenBSD-style IPv6
• drop ip6.int. reverse v6 DNS for good
• improve dealing with mixing v4/v6 transport
  ⇒ TODO add IP4SEND/IP6SEND support; currently; if IPSEND is v6
    but we send to a v4 server, we use INADDR_ANY for outgoing,
    as automatic fallback address

• dnscache can "ban" specified A records (dnscachet6 can also ban AAAA
  records) from being returned, rendering domains/hosts which resolve
  to these unusable, returning a NXDOMAIN. This can be used to "ban"
  wildcard second-level domains, such as those used by Verisign Corp.
• Most xxx programmes have an xxxt6 counterpart for IPv6 transport.
• This version also contains extensive patches to the IPv6 transport
  resolver to enable it as client to communicate with IPv4 nameservers.
• In addition to that, the IPv6 nameserver (tinydnst6) can handle
  listening on IPv4 addresses in this version, and, courtesy of fefe,
  listening on multiple addresses at once.
• Several IPv6-related bugs and fefe's shortcomings have been fixed.
• dnscachet6 can now listen on an IPv6 instead of IPv6 address too,
  but not (yet) multiple addresses. It uses IPv4/IPv6 transport on
  the outgoing side in both cases, though.

In the future, the xxxt6 binaries will replace the respective xxx
binaries with no way to get the v4-only behaviour back. We’re almost
there, as most of them now handle IPv4 transport as well, even on
the BSDs, as opposed to Fefe’s versions.

@The line
│    if (byte_equal(ip+12,4,V6any)) c=V6any;
is wrong in just so many ways. Firstly, it must be
│    if (byte_equal(ip+12,4,V4any)) c=V6any;
of course (hello Felix). Secondly, it just is broken.

0.0.0.0 is *not* the same as [::] but [::FFFF:0.0.0.0]
in this software. You shan’t bind to [::] if I set the
env/IP variable to 0.0.0.0, ever. Dual vs Doble Stack.
