log
@* there is no axfrdns with IPv6 transport¹²
* add inetd wrapper for axfrdns²
* write out the wrapper correctly automatically in axfrdns-conf(8)
* document that
* mark as for MirOS BSD and OpenBSD only due to arc4random(3) usage
* add port version (for zonenotify) and mksh path (for the
  inetd wrapper in axfrdns-conf) to CPPFLAGS
* build zonenotify
* tinydns-data: fix warnings (conversion)
* sync PLIST
* bump package version

¹) unless you tweak UCSPI-TCP
²) or inetd.conf (tcp4, tcp6)

tested against a 'dig @@1.2.3.4 axfr my.domain' on an openbsd box,
so I suppose it works ok
