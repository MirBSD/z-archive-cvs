@complete overhaul of djbdns port:

‚Ä¢ merge t4/t6 flavours back into one binary
  ‚Ä£ greatly simplify IPv6 handling, too; drop code for v6-less OSes
‚Ä¢ merge v4/v6 dnsroots back into one, update all of them
‚Ä¢ improve documentation a bit
‚Ä¢ apply two patches from http://www.your.org/dnscache/ (SECURITY):
  ‚Ä£ merge identical outgoing requests
  ‚Ä£ allow caching SOA responses
‚Ä¢ update to Fefe‚Äôs djbdns-1.05-test27.diff.bz2
  ‚Ä£ fixes recursively resolving hosts behind IPv6-only nameservers;
    spotted by Natureshadow (for Teckids‚Äô Lunatics network) and via
    http://serverfault.com/q/627912/189656 (which I‚Äôll answer RSN)
  ‚ö† fix with ‚Äúone second‚Äù CDB validity patch
  ‚ö† adapt for OpenBSD-style IPv6
‚Ä¢ drop ip6.int. reverse v6 DNS for good
‚Ä¢ improve dealing with mixing v4/v6 transport
  ‚áí TODO add IP4SEND/IP6SEND support; currently; if IPSEND is v6
    but we send to a v4 server, we use INADDR_ANY for outgoing,
    as automatic fallback address

@* make zonenotify connect to IPv6 (DNS or numeric) too
* make zonenotify connect to all IPs of the hostname given
* make axfrdns log IPv6 addresses (have to move it though)
  XXX pending making DJB_V6ONLY the default and only case
* put fromhex into common file while here
* centralise licence info for my diffs while here
* bump patchlevel

new zonenotify loosely tested, new axfrdns log format seems okay
thanks gecko2 for providing bind9 backup NS on ipv6

1.2
log
@* there is no axfrdns with IPv6 transportπ≤
* add inetd wrapper for axfrdns≤
* write out the wrapper correctly automatically in axfrdns-conf(8)
* document that
* mark as for MirOS BSD and OpenBSD only due to arc4random(3) usage
* add port version (for zonenotify) and mksh path (for the
  inetd wrapper in axfrdns-conf) to CPPFLAGS
* build zonenotify
* tinydns-data: fix warnings (conversion)
* sync PLIST
* bump package version

π) unless you tweak UCSPI-TCP
≤) or inetd.conf (tcp4, tcp6)

tested against a 'dig @@1.2.3.4 axfr my.domain' on an openbsd box,
so I suppose it works ok
