@complete overhaul of djbdns port:

• merge t4/t6 flavours back into one binary
  ‣ greatly simplify IPv6 handling, too; drop code for v6-less OSes
• merge v4/v6 dnsroots back into one, update all of them
• improve documentation a bit
• apply two patches from http://www.your.org/dnscache/ (SECURITY):
  ‣ merge identical outgoing requests
  ‣ allow caching SOA responses
• update to Fefe’s djbdns-1.05-test27.diff.bz2
  ‣ fixes recursively resolving hosts behind IPv6-only nameservers;
    spotted by Natureshadow (for Teckids’ Lunatics network) and via
    http://serverfault.com/q/627912/189656 (which I’ll answer RSN)
  ⚠ fix with “one second” CDB validity patch
  ⚠ adapt for OpenBSD-style IPv6
• drop ip6.int. reverse v6 DNS for good
• improve dealing with mixing v4/v6 transport
  ⇒ TODO add IP4SEND/IP6SEND support; currently; if IPSEND is v6
    but we send to a v4 server, we use INADDR_ANY for outgoing,
    as automatic fallback address

@.TH pickdns 8

.SH NAME
pickdns \- a load-balancing DNS server.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pickdns
accepts iterative DNS queries
from hosts around the Internet,
and responds with a dynamic selection of locally configured IP addresses
with 5-second TTLs.

In versions 1.04 and above, the features of
.B pickdns
have been integrated into
.BR tinydns (8).

.SH Configuration
Normally
.B pickdns
is set up by the
.BR pickdns-conf (8)
program.

.B pickdns
runs chrooted in the directory
specified by the
.I $ROOT
environment variable,
under the uid and gid
specified by the
.I $UID
and
.I $GID
environment variables.

.B pickdns
listens for incoming UDP packets
addressed to port 53 of
.IR $IP .
It does not listen for TCP queries.

.B pickdns
rejects
inverse queries, non-Internet-class queries, truncated packets,
packets that contain anything other than a single query,
and query types other than A or MX or *.
It looks up other queries inside
.IR data.cdb ,
a binary file created by
.BR pickdns-data (8).

.SH SEE ALSO
pickdns-conf(8),
pickdns-data(8)
