* consolidate all added source files in a central directory
  so it can be reused by the v6-transport stuff
* integrate the v6 transport binaries
* fix spacing
* sync descriptive texts with reality
* sync European ORSN (v4 and v6) to their root.hint
* sync OpenNIC too
* Open-RSC seeminly ceased to exist recently
* Apply compiler-temporary-filename.patch
  from http://homepages.tesco.net/~J.deBoynePollard/FGA/djbdns-problems.html
* apply dnscache-cname-handling.patch
* apply dnscache-strict-forwardonly.patch w/ IPv6 tweak
* apply dnscacheip-space-separator.patch
* apply tinydns-alias-chain-truncation.patch
* apply tinydns-data-semantic-error.patch
  appropriately for 6 and 3, too
* fix shell code and path to includes
* fix relative paths
* fix names of library and programmes; NOMAN=yes here (t6)
