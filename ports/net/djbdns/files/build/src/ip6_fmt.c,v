@complete overhaul of djbdns port:

• merge t4/t6 flavours back into one binary
  ‣ greatly simplify IPv6 handling, too; drop code for v6-less OSes
• merge v4/v6 dnsroots back into one, update all of them
• improve documentation a bit
• apply two patches from http://www.your.org/dnscache/ (SECURITY):
  ‣ merge identical outgoing requests
  ‣ allow caching SOA responses
• update to Fefe’s djbdns-1.05-test27.diff.bz2
  ‣ fixes recursively resolving hosts behind IPv6-only nameservers;
    spotted by Natureshadow (for Teckids’ Lunatics network) and via
    http://serverfault.com/q/627912/189656 (which I’ll answer RSN)
  ⚠ fix with “one second” CDB validity patch
  ⚠ adapt for OpenBSD-style IPv6
• drop ip6.int. reverse v6 DNS for good
• improve dealing with mixing v4/v6 transport
  ⇒ TODO add IP4SEND/IP6SEND support; currently; if IPSEND is v6
    but we send to a v4 server, we use INADDR_ANY for outgoing,
    as automatic fallback address

@* update to fefe's djbdns-1.05-test23.diff
  with djbdns-1.05-ixfr.diff
* slightly change naming of v6-transport binaries
* consolidate all added source files in a central directory
  so it can be reused by the v6-transport stuff
* integrate the v6 transport binaries
* fix spacing
* sync descriptive texts with reality
* sync European ORSN (v4 and v6) to their root.hint
* sync OpenNIC too
* Open-RSC seeminly ceased to exist recently
* Apply compiler-temporary-filename.patch
  from http://homepages.tesco.net/~J.deBoynePollard/FGA/djbdns-problems.html
* apply dnscache-cname-handling.patch
* apply dnscache-strict-forwardonly.patch w/ IPv6 tweak
* apply dnscacheip-space-separator.patch
* apply tinydns-alias-chain-truncation.patch
* apply tinydns-data-semantic-error.patch
  appropriately for 6 and 3, too
* fix shell code and path to includes
* fix relative paths
* fix names of library and programmes; NOMAN=yes here (t6)
* Add support for the IPv6 transport module to communicate,
  as a client, with IPv4 transport name servers as well.

  WFM
* build it with -Wall -Werror
* honour ${SYSCONFDIR} throughout the port
