log
@* make zonenotify connect to IPv6 (DNS or numeric) too
* make zonenotify connect to all IPs of the hostname given
* make axfrdns log IPv6 addresses (have to move it though)
  XXX pending making DJB_V6ONLY the default and only case
* put fromhex into common file while here
* centralise licence info for my diffs while here
* bump patchlevel

new zonenotify loosely tested, new axfrdns log format seems okay
thanks gecko2 for providing bind9 backup NS on ipv6
