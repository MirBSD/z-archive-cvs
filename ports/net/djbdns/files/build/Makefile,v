@complete overhaul of djbdns port:

‚Ä¢ merge t4/t6 flavours back into one binary
  ‚Ä£ greatly simplify IPv6 handling, too; drop code for v6-less OSes
‚Ä¢ merge v4/v6 dnsroots back into one, update all of them
‚Ä¢ improve documentation a bit
‚Ä¢ apply two patches from http://www.your.org/dnscache/ (SECURITY):
  ‚Ä£ merge identical outgoing requests
  ‚Ä£ allow caching SOA responses
‚Ä¢ update to Fefe‚Äôs djbdns-1.05-test27.diff.bz2
  ‚Ä£ fixes recursively resolving hosts behind IPv6-only nameservers;
    spotted by Natureshadow (for Teckids‚Äô Lunatics network) and via
    http://serverfault.com/q/627912/189656 (which I‚Äôll answer RSN)
  ‚ö† fix with ‚Äúone second‚Äù CDB validity patch
  ‚ö† adapt for OpenBSD-style IPv6
‚Ä¢ drop ip6.int. reverse v6 DNS for good
‚Ä¢ improve dealing with mixing v4/v6 transport
  ‚áí TODO add IP4SEND/IP6SEND support; currently; if IPSEND is v6
    but we send to a v4 server, we use INADDR_ANY for outgoing,
    as automatic fallback address

@* there is no axfrdns with IPv6 transportπ≤
* add inetd wrapper for axfrdns≤
* write out the wrapper correctly automatically in axfrdns-conf(8)
* document that
* mark as for MirOS BSD and OpenBSD only due to arc4random(3) usage
* add port version (for zonenotify) and mksh path (for the
  inetd wrapper in axfrdns-conf) to CPPFLAGS
* build zonenotify
* tinydns-data: fix warnings (conversion)
* sync PLIST
* bump package version

π) unless you tweak UCSPI-TCP
≤) or inetd.conf (tcp4, tcp6)

tested against a 'dig @@1.2.3.4 axfr my.domain' on an openbsd box,
so I suppose it works ok

@* update to fefe's djbdns-1.05-test23.diff
  with djbdns-1.05-ixfr.diff
* slightly change naming of v6-transport binaries
* consolidate all added source files in a central directory
  so it can be reused by the v6-transport stuff
* integrate the v6 transport binaries
* fix spacing
* sync descriptive texts with reality
* sync European ORSN (v4 and v6) to their root.hint
* sync OpenNIC too
* Open-RSC seeminly ceased to exist recently
* Apply compiler-temporary-filename.patch
  from http://homepages.tesco.net/~J.deBoynePollard/FGA/djbdns-problems.html
* apply dnscache-cname-handling.patch
* apply dnscache-strict-forwardonly.patch w/ IPv6 tweak
* apply dnscacheip-space-separator.patch
* apply tinydns-alias-chain-truncation.patch
* apply tinydns-data-semantic-error.patch
  appropriately for 6 and 3, too
* fix shell code and path to includes
* fix relative paths
* fix names of library and programmes; NOMAN=yes here (t6)
* Add support for the IPv6 transport module to communicate,
  as a client, with IPv4 transport name servers as well.

  WFM
* build it with -Wall -Werror
* honour ${SYSCONFDIR} throughout the port

@New djbdns port, #ifdef'd, "original" and "no_ipv6" flavours removed
"no_ipv4" non-functional at the moment, will follow later after
redesign using crunchgen(1) and crunchide(1)
