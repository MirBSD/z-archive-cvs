log
@complete overhaul of djbdns port:

• merge t4/t6 flavours back into one binary
  ‣ greatly simplify IPv6 handling, too; drop code for v6-less OSes
• merge v4/v6 dnsroots back into one, update all of them
• improve documentation a bit
• apply two patches from http://www.your.org/dnscache/ (SECURITY):
  ‣ merge identical outgoing requests
  ‣ allow caching SOA responses
• update to Fefe’s djbdns-1.05-test27.diff.bz2
  ‣ fixes recursively resolving hosts behind IPv6-only nameservers;
    spotted by Natureshadow (for Teckids’ Lunatics network) and via
    http://serverfault.com/q/627912/189656 (which I’ll answer RSN)
  ⚠ fix with “one second” CDB validity patch
  ⚠ adapt for OpenBSD-style IPv6
• drop ip6.int. reverse v6 DNS for good
• improve dealing with mixing v4/v6 transport
  ⇒ TODO add IP4SEND/IP6SEND support; currently; if IPSEND is v6
    but we send to a v4 server, we use INADDR_ANY for outgoing,
    as automatic fallback address
