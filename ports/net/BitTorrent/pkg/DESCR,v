@Initial revision

@BitTorrent is a tool for distributing files (a "file swarming
application"). Whenever more than one person is downloading at
once they send pieces of the file(s) to each other, thus
relieving the central server's bandwidth burden. Even with many
simultaneous downloads, the upload burden on the central server
remains quite small, since each new downloader introduces new
upload capacity.
