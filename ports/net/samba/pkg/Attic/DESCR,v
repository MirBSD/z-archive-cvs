@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@The Samba suite is a set of programmes which run under most UNIX
and UNIX-like operating systems and implement the Server Message
Block protocol suite. These programmes deliver most of the
important functionality of a Microsoft Lan Manager server. That
is, they support remote access to UNIX filespace and UNIX printers
from Lan Manager compatible clients. In practical terms, this
means that such clients can connect to and use UNIX filespace as
if it was a local disc drive, or UNIX printers as if they were
local printers.

Some of the most popular Lan Manager compatible clients include Lan
Manager itself, Windows for Workgroups, OS/2 and Windows NT.

Available flavours:

ads	Enable Active Directory support (OpenBSD only)
cups	Enable CUPS support
ldap	Enable LDAP support

Available subpackage:

docs	Documentation in HTML and PDF (manual pages are part of
	the base package)
