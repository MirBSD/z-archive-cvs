@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@$MirOS: ports/net/samba/pkg/SECURITY,v 1.1 2005/03/18 15:49:02 tg Exp $

* smbd/server.c must be compiled without ProPolice SSP, thus
  leaving the Server Message Block daemon wide open for a
  buffer overflow attack.

  The smb daemon errored out in function open_sockets_smbd
  but I cannot find the itch to scratch in order to fix it.
  It may be a SSP malfunction, it may be a real bug in smbd;
  I don't know.
