@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@Using samba package in OpenBSD environment:

1. Edit /etc/samba/smb.conf to suit your needs.

2. Edit /etc/rc.conf.local:
   ...
smbd_flags="-D"		# for normal use: "-D"
nmbd_flags="-D"		# for normal use: "-D"
   ...

3. Edit /etc/rc.local:
   echo -n 'starting local daemons:'
   ...
if [ -f /etc/samba/smb.conf ]; then
	if [ X"${smbd_flags}" != X"NO" -a -x /usr/local/libexec/smbd ]; then
		echo -n ' smbd';    /usr/local/libexec/smbd ${smbd_flags}
	fi
	if [ X"${nmbd_flags}" != X"NO" -a -x /usr/local/libexec/nmbd ]; then
		echo -n ' nmbd';    /usr/local/libexec/nmbd ${nmbd_flags}
	fi
fi
   ...
   echo '.'

Steps 4 and 5 are only necessary if you want to enable swat (Samba 
Web Administration Tool). Please note that administering the server
with swat over a network is inadvisable as passwords are passed in
the clear. You can avoid this problem by using ssh forwarding to
port 901.

4. add the following entry to /etc/inetd.conf:

   ...
swat	stream	tcp	nowait.400 root	/usr/local/libexec/swat  swat
swat	stream	tcp6	nowait.400 root	/usr/local/libexec/swat  swat
   ...

5. add the following entry to /etc/services (OpenBSD only):

   ...
   swat            901/tcp                 # samba admin service
   ...

Install the samba-docs package and see documentation files in
/usr/local/share/doc/samba and example config files in
/usr/local/share/examples/samba for more information.
