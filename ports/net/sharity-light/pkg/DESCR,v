@If you want a short description of what Sharity-Light can do for you: you can 
mount volumes exported by Windows or related operating systems on your Unix 
machine.

What does Sharity-Light do?
===========================
If you know smbfs for Linux: Sharity-Light is roughly the same. It is
derived from smbfs, but runs as a user level program, not in the kernel.
If you know samba: Sharity-Light is roughly the opposite: a client for the
Lanmanager protocol. If you know neither of these: Sharity-Light lets you
mount drives exported by Windows (f.Workgroups/95/NT), Lan Manager, OS/2
etc. on Unix machines.
