@ICMPINFO:

   icmpinfo is a tool for looking at the icmp messages received on
   the running host.

   The source code comes from an heavily modified BSD ping source.
   
USAGE:

icmpinfo       o Gives info about weird packets only [mainly icmp_unreachable].
icmpinfo -v    o Gives info about all icmp packets [that includes your own
                 traceroutes...] except pings (icmp_echo_reply).
icmpinfo -vv   o To see pings too.
icmpinfo -vvv  o Will add an ascci/hexa dump of the packet.
icmpinfo -n    o Avoids name queries (faster, lighter).
icmpinfo -p    o Avoids port number to service name queries (faster, lighter).
icmpinfo -s    o Also decode the ip_src field which is the address of the
                 interface receiving the packet. This option is not usefull
                 for hosts with a single network interface. 
icmpinfo -l    o Run like a daemon (forks) and output to SYSLOG.
                 (It now checks that you are root for that)
