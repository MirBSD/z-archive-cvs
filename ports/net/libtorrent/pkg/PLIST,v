log
@* infrastructure/mk/bsd.port.mk: never compile C++ code with
  -fomit-frame-pointer as this seems to break exceptions
  reported by: libtorrent/rtorrent wiki
* devel/libsigc++: speed up build; be explicit about building
  of shared or static libraries; regen distinfo; fix indentation
* net/libtorrent, net/rtorrent: update to latest UNSTABLE ver-
  sion (because the STABLE version has, according to upstream,
  known bugs); enable IPv6; use "autogen" configuration style,
  because "autoconf" doesn't work any more because upstream
  wishes to use libtool 2.0-beta which has an interface incom-
  patible to libtool 1.4, 1.5 and mirlibtool; speed up build;
  be explicit about minimum curl version; add default session
  dir example (commented out) to rtorrent.rc; apply fix for the
  slow hashing problem (from upstream); indent properly

@add libtorrent/rtorrent ports, idea from Han Boetes
this time I wrote the Makefiles myself instead of
stealing from other ports ;)
