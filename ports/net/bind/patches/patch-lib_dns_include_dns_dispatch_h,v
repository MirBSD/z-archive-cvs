1.1
log
@Update bind to 9.3.4-P1 (9.3.4.1-0 for us). That Other BSD says that this
version is not vulnerable to those cache poisoning attacks, but still
switch to ISC's new id generator and MANUALLY apply the patch.

I actually had to download both upstream tarballs and do a recursive diff
as ISC does not provide a patch, only a new version. Oh, and they chose to
integrate some win32 changes as well for good measure. Sigh.
