@XNetload displays bytes traffic and uptime for a network connection in an
X window. It can also be used to monitor a given network interface in a
dockapp-style manner. XNetload for NetBSD, OpenBSD and MirBSD uses code from
the wmnetload dockapp to determine the RX- and TX- buffer sizes
of a given network interface.
