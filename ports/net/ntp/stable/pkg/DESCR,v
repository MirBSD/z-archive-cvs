@The  Network  Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the
time of a computer client or server  to  another  server  or
reference time source, such as a radio or satellite receiver
or modem. It provides accuracies  typically  within  a  mil-
lisecond  on  LANs  and  up to a few tens of milliseconds on
WANs relative to Coordinated  Universal  Time  (UTC)  via  a
Global Positioning Service (GPS) receiver, for example. Typ-
ical NTP configurations utilize multiple  redundant  servers
and  diverse network paths in order to achieve high accuracy
and reliability. Some configurations  include  cryptographic
authentication  to  prevent accidental or malicious protocol
attacks and some provide automatic server discovery using IP
multicast.
