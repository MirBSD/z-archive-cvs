@NcFTP is a free set of programs that use the File Transfer Protocol.  It's
been around for quite some time now (circa 1992) and many people still use
the program and contribute suggestions and feedback.

The main program is simply called "ncftp".  There are also separate utility
programs for one-shot FTP operations (i.e. for shell scripts and command
line junkies);  these include "ncftpget", "ncftpput", and "ncftpls".  Run
each command without any arguments to see the usage screen, or read the
man page.
