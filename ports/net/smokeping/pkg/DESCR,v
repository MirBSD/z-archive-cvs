@SmokePing is a latency logging and graphing system. It consists of a
daemon process which organizes the latency measurements and a CGI which
presents the graphs.

 * quite fast because it uses FPing todo the actual pinging

 * easy to customize through a webtemplate and an extensive
   configuration file.

 * written in perl and should readily port to any unix system

 * extensible through plug-in modules

 * an RRDtool frontend

 * able to deal with DYNAMIC IP addresses as used with Cable
   and ADSL internet.
