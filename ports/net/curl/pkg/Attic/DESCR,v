@curl is a command line tool for transferring files with URL syntax,
supporting FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, TELNET, DICT, FILE
and LDAP. curl supports SSL certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, FTP
uploading, HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, user+password
authentication (Basic, Digest, NTLM, Negotiate, kerberos...), file
transfer resume, proxy tunneling and a busload of other useful tricks.

This port looks in ${SYSCONFDIR}/ssl/certs for X.509 CA certificates.

@• upgrade to 7.16.2
• let this search ${SYSCONFDIR}/etc/ssl/certs by default
  (so that curl https://herc.mirbsd.org/foo works on a default install)

ATTENTION: this port hardcodes ${AUTOCONF_VERSION} instead of relying
on ${AUTOCONF_NEW} to pick the right one because it needs to use
autoconf-2.61 – this should be changed once we make 2.61 standard.
