@This package sends wake-on-lan (AKA magic) packets to turn on machines
that are wake-on-lan capable.

For now there is only one function in this package:
Net::Wake::by_udp([$host], $mac_address, [$port]);

You can omit the colons in the $mac_address, but not leading zeros.

Generally speaking, you should use a broadcast address for $host.  Using
the host's last known IP address is usually not sufficient since the IP
address may no longer be in the ARP cache. A $host value of
'255.255.255.255' is implied if $host is undef. If you wish to send a
magic packet to a remote subnet, you can use a variation of
'192.168.0.255', given that you know the subnet mask to generate the
proper broadcast address.
