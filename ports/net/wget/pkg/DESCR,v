@* Update to wget-1.10-2-0 (yeah. two dashes in the version number;
  this means trouble; I should have made it wget-1.10_2mp0 but we
  should have a fix soon; in the meanwhile, just remember to dein-
  stall your old package first)
* @@sample PLIST (XXX do I still need @@extra ?)

@Wget [formerly known as Geturl] is a freely available network utility
to retrieve files from the World Wide Web using HTTP and FTP, the two
most widely used Internet protocols.  It works non-interactively, thus
enabling work in the background, after having logged off.

The recursive retrieval of HTML pages, as well as FTP sites is
supported -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and home
pages, or traverse the web like a WWW robot (Wget understands
/robots.txt).

HTTPS and IPv6 (not on Interix) support has been integrated.

The code is of questionable quality and security.
