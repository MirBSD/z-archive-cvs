@here’s the promised tinyirc MirPort

still not fully functional as I’d like, but pretty good (e.g. on nwt)

text
@tinyirc is a small IRC client with basic support for
the RANDEX protocol (slave only), SIGWINCH, NickServ
via /NS, and a couple of bug fixes by MirBSD™.

It is also included on the MirOS baselive CDs.
