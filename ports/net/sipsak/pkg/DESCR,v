@Sipsak is a small command line tool for developers and administrators
of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) applications.  It can be used for
some simple tests on SIP applications and devices.  Some of its features
include the following:

* Sending OPTIONS request.
* Sending text files (which should contain SIP requests).
* Traceroute (see section 11 in RFC3261).
* User location test.
* Flooding test.
* Random character trashed test.
* Interpret and react on response.
* Authentication with qop supported.
* Short notation supported for receiving (not for sending).
