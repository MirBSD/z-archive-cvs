@Initial revision

@tcpshow reads a tcpdump(1) savefile and provides a reasonably complete
decode of Ethernet, IP, ICMP, UDP and TCP headers.  Boolean expressions
may also be specified for packet selection.  Data within the packets are
displayed in ASCII.

tcpshow's output is similar to Sun Solaris's snoop(1M) command for
network packet capture and inspection.
