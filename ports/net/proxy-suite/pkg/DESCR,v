@This is the SuSE Proxy-Suite, a set of programs to enhance firewall
security. The first (and currently only) component being released is the
FTP-Proxy.

FTP-Proxy
---------

- Securely relays FTP connections between clients and servers 
- Can switch connections from active to passive and vice versa 
- Utilizes port ranges for both control and data connections 
- Provides extensive auditing (via syslog or rotating log files) 
- Can separate user related from system triggered audit events 
- Provides command restriction based on logged in user name 
- Allows command argument checking with regular expressions
- Is able to retrieve configuration data from an LDAP directory (*)
- Has been thoroughly tested against buffer overflow attacks 
- Fully conforms to RFC 959 and 1123 (the basic FTP RFCs) 
- Planned to support RFC 1579 ("Firewall Friendly FTP") 
- Planned to support RFC 2428 (IPv6 Extensions for FTP) 
- Based on GNU AutoConf, supposed to run on many UNIX systems

(*) Not in this OpenBSD port.
