@==============================================================
You may need to add these entries to your /etc/services file 
to register the dhcp services:

dhcps	67/udp    # dhcp server
dhcpc	68/udp	  # dhcp client

Also, ensure that BPF support is compiled into the kernel.

Examples and documentation are in:
 ${PREFIX}/share/doc/wide-dhcp , and
 ${PREFIX}/share/examples/wide-dhcp
