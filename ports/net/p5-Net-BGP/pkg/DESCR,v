@This module is an implementation of the BGP-4 inter-domain routing
protocol. It encapsulates all of the functionality needed to establish
and maintain a BGP peering session and exchange routing update
information with the peer. It aims to provide a simple API to the BGP
protocol for the purposes of automation, logging, monitoring, testing,
and similar tasks using the power and flexibility of perl. The module
does not implement the functionality of a RIB (Routing Information Base)
nor does it modify the kernel routing table of the host system. However,
such operations could be implemented using the API provided by the
module.
