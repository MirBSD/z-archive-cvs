@neon is an HTTP and WebDAV client library, with a C interface. 

Featuring:

* High-level interface to HTTP and WebDAV methods (PUT, GET, HEAD etc)
* Low-level interface to HTTP request handling, to allow implementing new
  methods easily.
* persistent connections
* RFC2617 basic and digest authentication (including auth-int, md5-sess)
* Proxy support (including basic/digest authentication)
* SSL/TLS support using OpenSSL (including client certificate support)
* Generic WebDAV 207 XML response handling mechanism
* XML parsing using the expat or libxml parsers
* Easy generation of error messages from 207 error responses
* WebDAV resource manipulation: MOVE, COPY, DELETE, MKCOL.
* WebDAV metadata support: set and remove properties, query any set of
  properties (PROPPATCH/PROPFIND).
* autoconf macros supplied for easily embedding neon directly inside an
  application source tree.
