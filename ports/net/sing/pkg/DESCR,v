@SING stands for 'Send ICMP Nasty Garbage.' It is a tool that
sends ICMP packets fully customized from command line.  It's
main  purpose is to replace and complement the ping command,
adding  certain  enhancements  as  fragmentation;  send  and
receive  spoofed  packets;  send many ICMP information types
(echo as the old ping, address mask, timestamp,  and  router
discovery)   and   errors   (redirect,   unreach,  and  time
exceeded); and send monster packets.  It also supports loose
and strict source routing and record routing.
