1.1
log
@upgrade to rsync 3, GPLv3
• took me more than 2 hours
• book example of crazy buildsystem:
  ‣ does not use libtool or automake/aclocal
  ‣ does not use iconv.m4
  ‣ uses configure.sh custom filename for configure script
• bump version, remove old CVE fix
• switch to CONFIGURE_STYLE=autoconf
• add a touching file (rsyncam.dep) for “configure.sh” processing ☹
• use --disable-iconv explicitly for -static flavour
• use libiconv module (dependency) for normal flavour
• patch configure.in to use our iconv.m4 file
• install a few more doc files
• make rsync *NOT* link against -liconv if --disable-iconv is given!
  ‣ prevents a DT_NEEDED which otherwise appeared even if
    no function from the iconv library was imported!
• when calling $CC with -c, always add $CFLAGS $CPPFLAGS (sigh…)
• support MidnightBSD: we assume they have FreeBSD xattr support
