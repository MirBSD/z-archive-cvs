@pretty straight-forward update of rsync:

• add most OpenBSD patches (but ignore rrsync)
• add a patch from Debian (adding -4/-6 to ssh on rsync -4/-6)

marked as “broken: do not use yet” because I’m targetting a
leap second patch for this release (rsync transfers time_t
over the network, which cannot go well…)

@Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool.
It can copy locally, to/from another host over any remote shell,
or to/from a remote rsync daemon. It offers a large number of options
that control every aspect of its behavior and permit very flexible
specification of the set of files to be copied. It is famous for
its delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount of data sent
over the network by sending only the differences between the source
files and the existing files in the destination. Rsync is widely
used for backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for
everyday use.

The rsync-static package is intended for use with AnonCVS as follows:
$ sudo install -c -o root -g _anoncvs -m 0110 \
    ${PREFIX}/bin/rsync-static /var/anoncvs/bin/rsync

Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool for
both remote and local files.  It communicates over a lower-level
protocol, such as rsh or ssh, allowing for secure updating.

Rsync uses a delta-transfer algorithm which provides a very fast method
for bringing remote files into sync.  It does this by sending just the
differences in the files across the link, without requiring that both
sets of files are present at one of the ends of the link beforehand.
Typically, this uses a very small bandwidth compared to e.g. rdist.

On the down side, rsync is not quite as versatile as rdist when it comes to
mirroring only part of a hierarchy, though one can possibly use a perl
wrapper to obtain the same adaptability.

@move anoncvs stub from /var/anoncvs/anoncvs to /var/anoncvs,
shell from /var/anoncvs/anoncvssh to /usr/libexec/anoncvssh,
devices are now on mfs, fix some typos etc. while here

=> /var/anoncvs and its subdirectories can now be mounted
   with nodev and nosuid

condition on the mfs mount: at least one user must exist
whose home directory is /var/anoncvs (or one of its sub-
directories), whose shell is /usr/libexec/anoncvssh, and
whose password is not empty ('*'); /var/anoncvs/dev will
be filled with arandom, null and zero.

also enforce stricter perms on cvs and rsync binaries in
the chroot (0110 root:_anoncvs)

do not change anything pertaining to the MirOS mirrors
yet, as these will have to be changed to match the new
default values with some OS upgrade later
