@Port the EFF's The Onion Router, with slight help from pkgsrcÂ®.
Untested so far. (But this will change.)
@
text
@The simple version: Tor provides a distributed network of servers
("onion routers"). Users bounce their TCP streams (web traffic, FTP,
SSH, etc.) around the routers. This makes it hard for recipients, ob-
servers, and even the onion routers themselves to track the source of
the stream.

The complex version: Onion Routing is a connection-oriented anonymi-
sing communication service. Users choose a source-routed path through a
set of nodes, and negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in
which each node knows its predecessor and successor, but no others.
Traffic flowing down the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at
each node, which reveals the downstream node.
