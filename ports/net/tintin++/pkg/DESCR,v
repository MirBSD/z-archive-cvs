@     TINTIN++ is a client program specialized to help playing muds.
     This is a souped up version of TINTIN III, many new features
     have been added since III.  We saw room for improvement on the
     features available from TINTIN, and since we like the format of
     the program, we decided to use TINTIN as a base for what we
     hope to make one of the most powerful clients around.
