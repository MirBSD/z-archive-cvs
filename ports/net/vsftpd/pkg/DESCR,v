@vsftpd is an FTP server, or daemon. The "vs" stands for Very Secure.
It has been written with security in mind, and carefully designed to
be resilient to attack.

Recent evidence shows that vsftpd is also extremely fast and scalable.
vsftpd has achieved ~4000 concurrent users on a single machine, in a
production environment.
