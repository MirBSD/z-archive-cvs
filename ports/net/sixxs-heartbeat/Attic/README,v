@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@$MirOS: ports/net/sixxs-heartbeat/README,v 1.4 2006/05/27 21:12:49 tg Exp $

The SixXS heartbeat client is obsolete: there is an AICCU/AYIYA (wtf?)
thing in testing.
The SixXS heartbeat client also was broken on recent systems, so we
have removed it. Please do not ask us to have it come back.

For the curious: there is a quick-hack SixXS heartbeat protocol client
available (well, it's actually damn stable and good working):
$ cvs -d ${_MIROS_ANONCVS} \
> co -PA contrib/samples/codesnippets/hbclient

Please read the enclosed instructions.

No complete transition yet, but this helps a lot with
the recent and upcoming(!) domain issues.

Please use only http://mirbsd.de/ as mirror redirector
and only http://cvs.mirbsd.de/ as CVSweb redirector.
Please do not use mirbsd.de for anything else save eMail.
