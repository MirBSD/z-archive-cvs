@Mutella is a terminal-mode Gnutella client with an intuitive and easy
to use interface. Initially written by Max for himself, Mutella has
now been released to the general public for the benefit of all of us
in need of a solid, high-performance client.
       
Mutella supports all the functionality required to participate as a
full-featured node in the Gnutella network. "Full-featured" implies
support for file search, download and sharing.
                 
Optimized for a high-bandwidth connection, it sets standards for the
server performance and stability. However, Mutella is also happy to
run on a modest-speed line.
