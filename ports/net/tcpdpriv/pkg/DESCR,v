@Tcpdpriv removes sensitive information from a packet trace, replacing it
with contrived information from which the sensitive information cannot be
reconstructed.  By removing the sensitive information, the output of
tcpdpriv may be shared with others (for debugging or network analysis,
say).

For a possible attack see ${PREFIX}/share/doc/tcpdpriv/attack50.ps.

Support for pflog output from Can Erkin Acar <canacar@@eee.metu.edu.tr>.
Support for IPv6, ICMP and ARP was adapted from Kenjiro Cho's
<kjc@@csl.sony.co.jp> hacked version of tcpdpriv.
