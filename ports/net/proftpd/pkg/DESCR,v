@ProFTPD is a highly configurable ftp daemon for unix
and unix-like operating systems. ProFTPD is designed
to be somewhat of a "drop-in" replacement for wu-ftpd
with a configuration format like Apache.

Full online documentation is available at
http://www.proftpd.org/, including a server
configuration directive reference manual.

Flavours:
    
    mysql: Support for MySQL
    
    ldap: Support for LDAP
    
    pgsql: Support for PostgreSQL
