@• remove ports that are simply broken, don't work, for too long, with no
  update or update-willing person in sight, kde stuff, web2.0 stuff that
  we don't want in ports (just stuff it into /var/www yourself, it isn't
  that difficult, right?), stuff for which no new version exists/will be
  and some obsd cruft; adjust dependencies
• no BUILD_DEPENDS+=RUN_DEPENDS or vice versa any more, *ever*
• fix some other stuff partially

@GnomeICU is a program based on Mirabilis' ICQ protocol, and designed for use
with the Gtk+ widget library.  It is meant to be a high speed, high quality
alternative for Mirabilis' Java client (Mirabilis' only attempt at a Linux
client).  Though GnomeICU is quite stable at this time, it is still
development software, and most certainly contains bugs.
