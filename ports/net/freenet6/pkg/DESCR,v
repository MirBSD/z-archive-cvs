@Freenet6 is a free IPv6 access service offered by Hexago. This service
enables thousands of people from all over the world to experience the
best solution for a smooth and incremental deployment of IPv6.

Instead of a Web interface, which is usually offered by traditional
tunnel brokers, Freenet6 uses an innovative model based on the TSP
Client. The TSP Client is software that usually runs on a PC and that
implements the Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP). The TSP Client is used to
automatically negotiate a configured tunnel between a PC or router and
the Freenet6 tunnel broker, making IPv6 easy to install and maintain.
The TSP Client source code is licensed under the GPL. A commercial
license is also available.
