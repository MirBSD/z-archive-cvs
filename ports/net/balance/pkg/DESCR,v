@Balance is a simple but powerful generic tcp proxy with round robin
load balancing and failover mechanisms. Its behaviour can be
controlled at runtime using a simple command line syntax.

The latest release now supports the definition of channel groups
and connection counting and handling boosting the power and versatility
of balance one big step further.
