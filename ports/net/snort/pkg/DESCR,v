@Snort is a fairly intelligent sniffer/NIDS, with a very strong rule set.

Snort can perform protocol analysis, content searching/matching and can be used
to detect a variety of attacks and probes, such as buffer overflows, stealth
port scans, CGI attacks, SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, and much more. 

Snort uses a flexible rules language to describe traffic that it should collect
or pass, as well as a detection engine that utilizes a modular plugin
architecture.  Snort has a real-time alerting capability as well, incorporating
alerting mechanisms for syslog, a user specified file, a UNIX socket, or
WinPopup messages to Windows clients using Samba's smbclient. 

Available flavours:
	postgresql - enable postgresql database logging support
	mysql	   - enable mysql database logging support
	smbalert   - enable samba logging support
	flexresp   - enable dynamic connection killing support
