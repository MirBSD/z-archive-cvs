Post Installation Set-Up of trickle
-----------------------------------

See trickle(1), trickled.conf(5), and trickled(8) for information on
configuring and using trickle.  The optional trickled.conf configuration
file should be placed at ${SYSCONFDIR}/trickled.conf.

Additionally, you may wish to start trickled at system start-up time
via the /etc/rc.local script (it should be noted that trickled can run
with, but does not require root privileges):

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/bin/trickled ]; then
        echo -n ' trickled';     ${PREFIX}/bin/trickled
fi
