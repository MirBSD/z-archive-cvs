@Nam is a Tcl/Tk based animation tool for viewing network simulation traces 
and real world packet traces. It supports topology layout, packet level 
animation, and various data inspection tools. 

Nam began at LBL. It has evolved substantially over the past few years. 
The nam development effort is now an ongoing collaboration with 
the VINT project.
