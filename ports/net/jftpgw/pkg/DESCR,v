@jftpgw is an FTP proxy/gateway that uses the FTP protocol (unlike those
FTP proxies that fetch an FTP file but work as an HTTP proxy). You can use
it to make servers behind a firewall/NAT server (masquerading server)
accessible or to allow users behind such solutions to transfer files to
and from the outside of the LAN.
