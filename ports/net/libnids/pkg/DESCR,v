@Libnids is a library that provides a functionality of one of NIDS
(Network Intrusion Detection System) components, namely E-component. It means
that libnids code watches all local network traffic, cooks received datagrams
a bit (quite a bit ;)), and provides convenient information on them to
analyzing modules of NIDS. Libnids performs:
	a) assembly of TCP segments into TCP streams
	b) IP defragmentation
	c) TCP port scan detection
