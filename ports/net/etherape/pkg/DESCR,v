@EtherApe is a graphical network monitor for Unix modeled after
etherman. Featuring link layer, ip and TCP modes, it displays network
activity graphically. Hosts and links change in size with traffic.
Color coded protocols display. It supports Ethernet, FDDI, Token
Ring, ISDN, PPP and SLIP devices. It can filter traffic to be shown,
and can read traffic from a file as well as live from the network.
