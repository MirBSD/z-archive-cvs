@Initial revision

@mtr combines the functionality of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs
in a single network diagnostic tool.

As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host
mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host.  After it
determines the address of each network hop between the machines, it
sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the
quality of the link to each machine.  As it does this, it prints
running statistics about each machine.
