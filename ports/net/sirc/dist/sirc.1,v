.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sirc
[options] [nickname [server]]

.BR "\-d"
Starts
.B sirc
in dumb mode (without the full-screen front-end).

.BR "\-p \fI<port>\fR"
Specifies the port number to connect to.
Prefix the number with a "s" to use SSL.
.TP
.BR "\-i \fI<name>\fR"
Specifies the IRCNAME to use (the default being "sirc user").
.TP
.BR "\-n \fI<nick>\fR"
Sets the nickname.
.TP
.BR "\-s \fI<server>\fR"
Sets the server that
.B sirc
should connect to.
.TP
.BR "\-l \fI<filename>\fR"
Specifies a file to be loaded instead of ~/.etc/sircrc.pl.
.TP
.BR "\-L \fI<filename>\fR"
Specifies a file of commands to run, instead of ~/.etc/sircrc.
.TP
.BR "\-H \fI<hostname>\fR"
Specifies a hostname to bind to, as a virtual host.
.TP
.BR "\-q"
Doesn't load ~/.etc/sircrc.pl or the system-wide sircrc.pl.
.TP

.TP
.BR "\-R"
Runs in restricted mode (no shell access, no access to files).
.TP
.BR "\-7"
Runs in seven-bit mode, stripping ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8 accented characters.
.TP
.BR "\-U"

to UTF-8 on the wire, and, vice versa, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-15, cp1252
and UTF-8 on the wire to ISO-8859-1 on the local terminal.
The input is still tried to be parsed as UTF-8 first.
.TP

to \fIcharset\fR.
Supported charsets are listed in Encode(3p).

.TP
.BR "\-T"

the environment variables SIRCNAME or IRCNAME.

password can be given in the form \fIserver.host\fR:\fIport\fR:\fIpasswd\fR.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sirc
is an IRC client that is designed to act much like ircII, except for
the scripting interface, which uses perl.
mIRC colour codes and Colloquy-induced ^A characters framing
brackets around nicknames are automatically stripped.

All IRC commands start with a /, and a detailed description of them is given by
the command /help.
