implemented, so $0 evaluates to the first argument, $1 the second, etc.,

to the contents of that variable, such as $nick or $talkchannel (see
the PROGRAMMING docs for a list of these variables).

@@newuser
IRC is an international multi-user chat network organised in channels;
each IRC user is known by a nickname. Communication with other users
is either by private messages or by talking in channels.

All sirc commands begin with a /, and anything that does not begin
with a / is sent to your current channel.

To get started, it will be useful to check the help on the following
commands:  NICK, QUIT, LIST, WHOIS, MSG, JOIN, HOP, LL, keys
