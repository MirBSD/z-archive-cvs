english FAQ:

A reconnect-script has been installed as ${PREFIX}/sbin/pptp-reconnect,
edit it to reflect your environment.

Next, setup /etc/ppp/{options,chap-secrets,pap-secrets} with
information provided by your ISP.

If you get "LCP timeout sending config request" messages, build a
kernel without "GRE encapsulation interface" support.
(NB: look in /usr/src/sys/conf/GENERIC for "pseudo-device   gre     1".)

You may want to use TCP/IP packet filter rules to prevent unauthorized 
access to your modem (from internal net or spoofed/bounced TCP/IP packets).
