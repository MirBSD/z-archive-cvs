@Irssi is a modular IRC client that currently has only text mode
user interface, but 80-90% of the code isn't text mode specific,
so other UIs could be created pretty easily. Also, Irssi isn't
really even IRC specific anymore, there's already a working SILC
module available. Support for other protocols like ICQ could be
created some day too.

This irssi installation also comes with the randex module, which
to autoload is highly recommended.

Flavours:
* socks		support for dante socks firewall implementation
