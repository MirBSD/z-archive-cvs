log
@* change configure style to autoconf, move patch-configure to
  patch-configure_in
* convert to mirlibtool
* add MirOS as supported system (and a XXX in patch-include_atalk_util_h)
* MirOS GENERIC contains support
* under MirOS and Interix(?) we don't have tcp_wrappers
* sync distinfo, PLIST
* bump patchlevel
* plug a time_t issue

I'll leave the following open to others:
* convert PLIST to @@sample (easy but not trivial)
  hint: look at what is installed during fake time
* test
* update
* take maintainership

Hint of brokenness from Hawkeye via IRC, thanks
