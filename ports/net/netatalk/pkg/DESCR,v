@netatalk - File and Print Server for AppleTalk networks

netatalk is a server software for AppleTalk networks. Features include:

o Access to the UNIX filesystem for Macintosh and other systems with
  AppleShare client software.

o Spool PostScript print jobs to the lpd(8) spool system via Printer Access
  Protocol (PAP).

o Output PostScript print jobs from the lpd(8) spool system via Printer
  Access Protocol (PAP).

o Filter PostScript, ASCII, and various other formats to PostScript,
  including banner pages and page reversal.

o Route AppleTalk between multiple Ethernet interfaces.

Requires AppleTalk support in the kernel (OpenBSD 2.2 or newer).
Compile a kernel with option NETATALK (included in MirOS GENERIC).

@* change configure style to autoconf, move patch-configure to
  patch-configure_in
* convert to mirlibtool
* add MirOS as supported system (and a XXX in patch-include_atalk_util_h)
* MirOS GENERIC contains support
* under MirOS and Interix(?) we don't have tcp_wrappers
* sync distinfo, PLIST
* bump patchlevel
* plug a time_t issue

I'll leave the following open to others:
* convert PLIST to @@sample (easy but not trivial)
  hint: look at what is installed during fake time
* test
* update
* take maintainership

Hint of brokenness from Hawkeye via IRC, thanks
