@The server is mostly compatible with livingston radiusd-2.01
(no menus or s/key support though) but with more features,
such as:

 o Limit max. number of simultaneous logins.
 o Multiple DEFAULT entries.
 o Every entry can fall-through.
 o Huntgroup based access and configuration.
 o Extra "hints" file that can select SLIP/PPP/rlogin  based
   on  username  pattern  (Puser  or  user.ppp is PPP, plain
   "user" is rlogin etc).
 o Can execute an external program when user  has  authenti-
   cated (for example to run a sendmail queue).
 o Can include multiple files in users and dictionary files.
 o Can  act as a proxy server, relaying requests to a remote
   server.
 o Supports Vendor-Specific attributes.
