@Oinkmaster is simple Perl script released under the BSD license to help
you update your Snort 1.8+ rules and comment out the unwanted ones after
each update. It will tell you exactly what had changed since the last
update, hence giving you good control of your rules.

It's a variant of the (obsolete) arachNIDS snort rules updater
(http://nitzer.dhs.org/arachnids_upd/) which is pretty much the same
thing but for the arachNIDS Snort rules exports at
http://www.whitehats.com/.

Use with care and at your own risk.  Check out http://www.snort.org/ for
more information about Snort and its rules. Please note that the authors
of Snort have nothing to do with Oinkmaster so don't bother them about
silly Oinkmaster problems (and please don't hammer their site by
constant updating).
