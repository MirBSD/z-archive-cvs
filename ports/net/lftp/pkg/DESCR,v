@LFTP is a shell-like command line ftp and sftp client. 
It is reliable: can retry operations and does reget automatically.
It can do several transfers simultaneously in background.
You can start a transfer in background and continue browsing
the ftp site or another one. This all is done in one process.
Background jobs will be completed in nohup mode if you exit
or close modem connection. Lftp has reput, mirror, reverse
mirror among its features.
