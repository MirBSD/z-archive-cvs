@This distribution of the Multi-threaded Routing Toolkit includes
routing daemons, programming libraries, and Internet
routing statistics/performance measurement tools.

The work is supported by National Science Foundation grants
(NCR-9710176 and NCR-9318902), and a gift from Intel Corporation. 
	
Documentation and an installation guide for the MRT toolkit is 
available online at ${HOMEPAGE}.

This is alpha software.
