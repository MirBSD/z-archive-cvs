Title: MirOS project at Linuxtag 2007

Title: New look and feel
Date: 03.06.2007
Author: tg@@

<p>Some of you might have noticed the new look &amp; feel creeping onto
 a few of these pages. Well, after LinuxTag (it was a success, but not
 like they say in their press announcements, I'm rather laughing at these)
 and <a href="http://www.cul.de/freex.html">FreeX</a>, whose latest issue
 has an interesting article about MirOS BSD, and with mksh(1) getting more
 and more popular, I decided to skip on sleep and fun today and continue
 hacking on what I had already done for the website. Mostly content today.
 The <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">MirBSD Korn Shell</a> page got completely rewritten.
 If you find something, tell me. The theme will probably stay similar like
 the current one, not like <a href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/newsite/">Benny's</a>, but the index
 on the left will look totally different in some days. I'm only migrating
 (very) few of the old content. At the moment, “main”, “news”, “mksh” and
 “wlog-9” are converted, and the old CMS has been hacked for transparent
 migration to the new CMS (“mws”) using HTTP 301 redirects. Same goes for
 manual pages (/manN/ -&gt; /cman/manN/) to save space on search engines'
 hard disc drives. Finally, news and wlog now have permalinks (beta).</p>
<p>UPDATE (02.10.2007): Manpages now have better md redirects, and you can
 use various syntaxes, including /man/foo.1 or /man{i386,sparc}/bar.8</p>
<p>&#x60e3;&#x6d41;&#x30fb;&#x30a2;&#x30b9;&#x30ab;&#x30fb;&#x30e9;&#x30f3;&#x30b0;&#x30ec;&#x30fc;
 (well, just call him Soryu) and NetBSD®'s Stefan Schumacher have taken
 photographs of the MirOS team (the Duo Benny and me, Przemysław who run
 the booth as a mere user, and Much, whose new notebook got freshly set
 up, but who already knows how to like MirOS with evilwm); I'll put them
 up here once I get access to all of them.</p>
<p>Because we ran out of CDs, we put the ISO 9660 image on the <a
 href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent tracker</a>; please
 only redistribute it on CDs, DVDs or USB Sticks in order to comply with
 the licence of the Opera© browser included. You can, of course, also simply
 do a <a href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/current/">netinstall</a>.</p>

Title: mksh improves portability
Date: 05.06.2007

<p>The MirBSD Korn Shell (<a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh</a>) now can
 not only be built by the GNU Compiler Collection, egcs/gcc 2.95, the GNU
 C Compiler 2.7.2.3, and the (quite gcc-compatible) Sun Studio 12 C Compiler,
 but also by the Sun Studio 5.8 C Compiler on a Solaris 10 installation.
 Adding support for other vendor compilers will be much easier now.</p>
<p>These changes can be tested in the -current branch of mksh (and MirOS BSD)
 and will be released with the next major version, mksh R30. Furthermore, a
 few minor bugs were fixed and mirtoconfiguration is a little faster and more
 reliable now. Some of these changes may be MFC'd to mksh R29g, whose release
 date has not yet been decided upon (reads: when do <em>you</em> need it?).</p>
<p>Update: Intel's C Compiler (Version 9.1.042 and 10.0.023) work as well and
 have unveiled a few minor issues. The code is now smaller due to removal of
 orphaned code and variables GCC didn't spot. (I don't like icc though.) And in
 unrelated news: while we <em>do</em> now support OpenBSD's new CVS keyword
 <tt>$</tt><tt>Mdocdate$</tt>, we will not use it, so that the mksh(1) manual
 page remains usable on other operating systems.</p>

Title: First MirOS #10 Release Candidate published
Date: 09.06.2007

<p>The MirOS Project is proud to announce the availability of the first
 release candidate of the upcoming eleventh release of MirBSD, together
 with a stable release of the MirPorts Framework. This snapshot already
 advertises itself as MirOS #10 except for the OS patchlevel number and
 is available for download for the i386 architecture only.</p>
<p>Download, as usual, on the <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">
 BitTorrent tracker</a> (Live CD), or via a networked installation from
 various mirrors (<a href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/current/">DE</a>

Title: Fedora GNU/Linux now officially ships mksh
Date: 19.06.2007

<p>Thanks to a contributor who wishes to remain anonymous, <a
 href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh</a> is now officially shipped for
 Red Hat's GNU/Linux variants:</p><ul>
 <li>Fedora 7 (i386, amd64, ppc, ppc64 using gcc 4.1.2 and glibc 2.6
  at Linux 2.6.21)</li>
 <li>Fedora Core 6 (i386, amd64, ppc using gcc 4.1.1 and glibc 2.5
  at Linux 2.6.20)</li>
 <li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (i386, amd64, ppc using gcc 4.1.1 and
  glibc 2.5 at Linux 2.6.18)</li>
 <li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 (i386, amd64, ppc using gcc 3.4.3 and
  glibc 2.3.4 at Linux 2.6.9)</li>
</ul><p>We were informed that the all of these pass the testsuite. Fedora 7
 quality assurance is being run on it until approximately this weekend; to
 install mksh, simply type <tt>yum install mksh</tt> (for RHEL, you'll have
 to <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#head-fc43191402d7242da15ebb282c1a7dc948f6c852">enable
 the EPEL repository</a> first).</p>
<p>The Fink package manager for Mac OSX now also contains mksh R29f.</p>

Title: Most requested compatibility feature implemented in mksh
Date: 22.06.2007

<p>Countless users have requested we do the same as AT&amp;T ksh93 and bow
 to the “be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept”
 approach. Regarding to shell programming, this means we should support some
 of the most widely used extensions from other shells (ksh93, bash, zsh, csh,
 make(1)) as well.</p>
<p>Some hours of continuous cursing later, it's done. The current development
 version of <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh</a> R30β now supports GNU bash
 style array initialisations – and better than they, I might add:</p><ul>
 <li>OpenBSD ksh (from OpenBSD 4.1-current, 17 May 2007):<pre>
	$ x=(a b c)
	/bin/ksh: syntax error: `(' unexpected</pre></li>
 <li>GNU bash (from MirPorts Framework, 2.05b-1):<pre>
	$ v="d e"; x=('$a' "$v" c "(d)"); echo "${#x[*]}/${x[0]}/${x[1]}/${x[2]}/${x[3]}/"
	4/$a/d e/c/(d)/
	$ v="d e"; x=('$a' "$v" c (d)); echo "${#x[*]}/${x[0]}/${x[1]}/${x[2]}/${x[3]}/"
	bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('
	Segmentation fault
	$ v="d e"; x=('$a' "$v" c "(d)"; echo "${#x[*]}/${x[0]}/${x[1]}/${x[2]}/${x[3]}/"
	bash: syntax error near unexpected token `;'
	Segmentation fault
	$ bash -c 'v="d e"; x=('\''$a'\'' "$v" c "(d)"'
	bash: -c: line 1: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `)'
	Segmentation fault
	$ bash -c 'v="d e"; x=('\''$a'\'' "$v" c "(d)"; echo "${#x[*]}/${x[0]}/${x[1]}/${x[2]}/${x[3]}/"'
	bash: -c: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `;'
	bash: -c: line 1: `v="d e"; x=('$a' "$v" c "(d)"; echo "${#x[*]}/${x[0]}/${x[1]}/${x[2]}/${x[3]}/"'
	Segmentation fault</pre></li>
 <li>mksh (-current as of tonight):<pre>
	$ v="d e"; x=('$a' "$v" c "(d)"); echo "${#x[*]}/${x[0]}/${x[1]}/${x[2]}/${x[3]}/"
	4/$a/d e/c/(d)/
	$ v="d e"; x=('$a' "$v" c (d)); echo "${#x[*]}/${x[0]}/${x[1]}/${x[2]}/${x[3]}/"
	mksh: syntax error: '(' unexpected
	$ mksh -c 'v="d e"; x=('\''$a'\'' "$v" c "(d)"'
	mksh: syntax error: ')' missing
	$ mksh -c 'v="d e"; x=('\''$a'\'' "$v" c "(d)"; echo "${#x[*]}/${x[0]}/${x[1]}/${x[2]}/${x[3]}/"'
	mksh: syntax error: ')' missing</pre></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, we're continuing our not only tradition but also mission
 to provide working, reliable software. (If you try interactively typing one
 of the last two examples, mksh just waits for the closing parenthesis.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@permalinks/news_e20070605-nn.htm">our
 portability promise</a> is kept – mksh now also compiles fine with the vendor
 tools on HP-UX, which even have found a little shortcoming in the code I only
 can shake my head about… no idea who coded <em>that</em> ugly thing…</p>
<p>On unrelated news, bsiegert@@ has continued his work on bringing the GNOME
 ports into shape for the impending release of MirOS #10.</p>

Title: More mksh features, Download issues
Date: 06.07.2007

<p>We've finally implemented another bash-compatible feature in <a
 href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh</a>, namely variable substitution
 with substrings. Try <tt>print ${var:2:3}</tt>. The first character
 after the (first) colon must be numeric, an opening parenthesis, a
 dollar sign or a space right now; use <tt>${var: n: m}</tt> for the
 bash <tt>${var:n:m}</tt> (or <tt>${var:$n:m}</tt> or even
 <tt>${var:(n):m}</tt>). All of these are bash-compatible. This doesn't
 nest in either mksh or bash.</p>
<p>More features are to follow ☺</p>
<p>To install MirOS BSD, please use a <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@MirOS/current/">direct
 download</a> (or even netinstall from the same place) at the moment.
 We will provide MirOS #10RC2 as a Live+Install ISO image again at some
 time in the future (give us 1-2 weeks); MirOS #10RC1 contained a bug
 regarding the live CD part which went for a few days undetected; the
 creation of the ISO fell into that timeframe.</p>
<p>On a side note, the series of GNOME port updates is continuing.</p>

Title: mksh R29g released; impact of German law on MirOS base
Date: 09.07.2007

<p><a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh R29g</a> has been released mostly
 to fix large file support in some operating systems (mostly GNU), which
 was tested for correctly, but the test result was not used during the
 actual compilation. Found by hondza, thanks! This stable version update
 also contains some other minor changes from mksh-current that don't
 affect existing behaviour (so none of the nice features shown earlier)
 which aren't that noteworthy though. <small>There's still an issue in
 that <tt>-D_LARGE_FILES=1</tt> is defined even if it's not required
 sometimes, which is fixed in mksh-current, but it doesn't hurt.</small></p>
<p>German penal and crime code, Article 202c, forbids us from “retrieving,
 making available” (and some other things) tools that can be used to gain
 illegal access to data or access codes. While we do not approve of this law
 at all, we will be forced to abide by it in a few weeks (once it's been
 published in the print version of the parliament's papers), so tcpdump(8)
 was removed from the base system. We do not believe providing MirPorts
 makes us liable for the actions of the end user, and hope no other tool
 in the base system is affected by this law. We will try to make politicians
 realise how bad that is, as they are effectively preventing sysadmins as
 well as researchers, teachers and students from securing systems. (Maybe
 they just want to make us affected by the Federal Trojan?)</p>

Title: mksh now the default shell in FreeWRT
Date: 16.07.2007

<p>FreeWRT, an embedded applicance
 development kit, has adopted <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh</a> as its
 default shell and <tt>/bin/sh</tt> for the upcoming 1.1 release.</p>
<p>We would like to thank everyone for their support and feedback, hope that
 the upcoming mksh R30 will please even more, and suggest other projects,
 such as NetBSD®, to switch at least their native ksh to mksh.</p>

Title: sparc32 no longer in Debian; mksh with xlC
Date: 23.07.2007
Author: tg@@

<p>With apologies to every Debian user who is still on sparc32, XTaran of
 <a href="http://www.symlink.ch/">Symlink</a> fame has provided us with
 the idea: We aim to produce an operating system for 32-bit sparc boxen
 that is small, fast, stable, reliable and secure. MirOS/sparc is its name,
 and while it's currently being dormant, I promise it will be polished and
 shining in a short while. (I hope to get the issues I had some weeks ago
 solved, even at the cost of Ada support should that be necessary.)</p>
<p>I could use some parts for my SPARCstation 20 though: it only has a 75
 MHz supersparc CPU and 128 MiB RAM; if someone has a 233 MHz hypersparc
 CPU (I think Ross built these) I'd be delighted to upgrade, and more RAM
 never is bad. I've got some SCSI discs from tyler, so that's not urgent.</p>
<p><a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh</a> now builds with IBM XL C/C++ on
 AIX – Linux/POWER and Mac OSX shall follow once I'm able to test. Thanks
 to the person who wishes to remain anonymous for providing us the ability
 to do this porting work.</p>

Title: MirOS #10 RC3 available
Date: 01.08.2007

<p>The <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent tracker</a> now
 has a torrent for the MirOS #10 RC3 Live+Install CD; of course, the <a
 href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@MirOS/current/">netinstall location</a> has been upgraded with the
 new dist sets as well. You can now select a keyboard layout during livecd
 boot, and it's been made more user friendly; many small bugs have been
 plugged; <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">everyone's favourite shell</a> is
 at R30-current with support for TenDRA and maybe tcc, and several ports,
 most notably GNOME, are in good shape.</p>
<p><em>Please</em> <strong>report</strong> errors back to us; we don't plan
 on making any further changes to the codebase save bugfixes and maybe some
 more changes to ports.</p>

Title: mksh integrated into MidnightBSD
Date: 18.08.2007

<p>After <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@permalinks/news_e20070716-nn.htm">FreeWRT</a>,
 <a href="http://www.midnightbsd.org/">MidnightBSD</a>, a FreeBSD-based
 operating system, has adopted <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh</a> as its
 default Korn shell, that is, <tt>/bin/mksh</tt> and <tt>/bin/ksh</tt> (but
 not as <tt>/bin/sh</tt>). While the current <a
 href="http://www.midnightbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/bin/mksh/">state
 of integration</a> uses mksh R30, the upcoming R31 release with features
 requested by MidnightBSD developers will be integrated soon.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the developers of MidnightBSD for considering this
 and congratulate their users to gain a usable-by-default shell. We would
 also like to encourage other operating system developers to follow this
 example and integrate mksh (or, like OpenSolaris, AT&amp;T ksh93).</p>
----
Title: Hardware problems
Date: 21.08.2007

<p>Our main cvs and mailing list server, <tt>herc.mirbsd.org</tt>, has some
 hardware problems at the moment. This means that the mailing lists
 are down until further notice. Anonymous CVS access (not from allbsd.org),
 this website, and BitTorrent are working fine though.</p>

<p>Read/write CVS access to CVS for developers will be restored in one
 or two days, making tg@@’s SPARCstation the temporary CVS master.</p>

<p>Waldemar Brodkorb (wbx@@) has donated hardware to act as a supplemental
 AnonCVS/AnonRSYNC server, which is being initialised and tested right
 now, as the hosting site only accepts boxen that have passed a typical
 stress test. Eventually, this box will act as a secondary mail server
 as well.</p>

<p>For now, please use <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/MirBSD">IRC</a>
 for bug reports, feature requests, feedback, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> (2007-08-24): We’re almost back to normal,
 the server hardware has changed a little until proper replacement can
 be used (with proper, I mean replacing the IDE crap with SCSI, etc.
 while we’re at replacing anyway, and actually investing some – well, a
 lot of – money and effort). Mailing lists work again, and commits will
 be enabled for developers during short timeframes a few times per day,
 with immediate rsync actions being taken afterwards just to be on the
 safe side. This however means: FrOSCon CDs will contain older versions
 of MirOS, big financial loss for us, and MirOS #10 will be delayed for
 a yet unknown amount of time (but sparc is finally ready since 23rd).</p>
----
Title: MirOS #10-rc4 (i386) released, with a known bug
Date: 22.08.2007

<p>MirOS BSD #10 is coming near. The fourth release candidate for i386

 href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/current/i386/">i386</a> or <a
 href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/current/sparc/">sparc</a> platform,
 or do a network installation.</p>

<p><strong>Caveat</strong>: There is a bug in some of the <tt>fonts.alias</tt>
 files from the xbase set. If X fails to start, enter the following
 commands to fix the problem:</p>

<pre>$ sudo ed /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/fonts.alias
%s/iso8859-1$/iso10646-1/

 Bonn-Rhein-Sieg near Bonn, Germany. There is going to be a booth where
 you can meet the developers, and bsiegert@@ will hold a talk about
 <i>autoconf, automake, and libtool&mdash;an introduction to the GNU
 build system</i> on Sunday at 16:30, room 5.</p>

 adjusted LinuxTag edition, no more, not even more recent dist sets, due
 to all the trouble we had.</p>

 <td>XTaran of symlink.ch fame has finally helped us to test the latest,
  greatest and ultimately vt100, grey-on-blue / grey-on-black snapshot –
  as you can see, it boots up quite nicely. First, the text is still all
  black on white, but as soon as the framebuffer is initialised, that is
  switched to lightgrey on black, and further kernel messages are in our
  well-known, famous lightgrey on blue colour composition.<br />WARNING:
  The linked image is more than 1 MiB in size.</td>

<p>Furthermore, this very snapshot has been uploaded (for both the sparc
 and i386 architectures, with a readme for the former) to /MirOS/current
 and waits for your test results. We would be glad if someone could help
 us to fix the remaining bugs especially in the sparc port (nroff, issue
 with the bootloader and bsd.rd, etc).</p>
<p>The aforementioned XFree86 font issues have been solved provisionally
 by putting back the cropped and charset-reduced font sets; we will look
 into this issue after the release sometime.</p>

 (aka cnuke@@)’s very late bug report, which was done IRL instead of via IRC
 or eMail, which are the usual channels. This release fixes arc4random.c on
 SunOS due to them bad OpenBSD guys using non-standard types in an API.</p>
<p>Update 2: Everyone should upgrade to mksh R31b or later, due to the bug
 fixes and their relevance.</p>

----
Title: bootblocks now machine-independent, HTML manual pages split
Date: 21.10.2007

<p>The first-stage bootblocks (bootxx) of both the i386 and sparc architecture
 are now self-installing shell scripts that take an extent list (block spans)
 on standard input. This now allows to create, for example, bootable ISO9660
 images for MirBSD/i386 and MirBSD/sparc (or even both at the same time) on
 a MirBSD/i386 (or even GNU/Linux/i386) box. This is another milestone in the
 progress of making sparc a full-blown, supported, architecture.</p>
<p>The HTML manual pages have now been split into a machine-independent and a
 machine-dependent part (or rather, two of them) as well. This allows a much
 faster release generation on sparc. Furthermore, related manual pages, such
 as uuencode(1), uudecode(1), b64encode(1) and b64decode(1), now list all of
 their aliases in the title and are hard linked to save space and generation
 time (and hopefully search engine traffic, who knows).</p>
----
Title: mksh R32 released, plans for R33
Date: 25.10.2007

<p><a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh R32</a> has been released; read the
 <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm#clog">ChangeLog</a> for details. In short, an
 internal error when using pipelines as co-processes was fixed, array index
 bounds expanded, the build system improved, and everything cleaned up.</p>
<p>mksh R33 will address the namespace conflict between aliases and shell
 functions in a way Debian patched their pdksh package to go. This implies
 that FSH invocations will be able to define all common aliases again.</p>

<p>As you surely see, this page sports a brand-new design based on the old
 <a href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/newsite/">/newsite</a> CSS and the old one
 for www.mirbsd.org. The colors have been inverted (i.e. dark text on light

 DesktopBSD and PC-BSD CDs) at the usual place in the main building, and
 one with OpenBSD, NetBSD and MirOS in the AW building, near the shared
 PostgreSQL/BSD developer room. Meet us at the latter! CDs are out though
 (MirOS, FreeSBIE, etc. – only some of the other BSDs left).</p>
<p>Despite the crappy WLAN and no LAN availability even for booths, Benny

 very short-term follow-up #10semel release; mostly, security updates for
 XFree86® and a lot of ports. (FOSDEM was great as usual, though.)</p>
<p>The &lt;link rel=…&gt; tags for RSS have been fixed. After removing and

<p><a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh R33</a> has been released; read the
 <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm#clog">ChangeLog</a> for details. (Happy
 Birthday to everyone who has on this day.)</p>
<p>The news in short and human-readable:</p><ul>
 <li>Improved build system, once again; better error tracking; better
  portability with regards to tools in /usr/bin at build and compilers</li>
 <li>Integrate all changes from OpenBSD ksh</li>
 <li>Integrate some changes from Debian: the “dot” command needs an
  argument; prevent namespace conflict between (built-in) aliases and
  (POSIX, not Korn) shell functions</li>
 <li>Add <tt>\uXXXX</tt> and <tt>\xXX</tt> escapes to the print builtin</li>
 <li>No longer check if we are called as “sh” for special handling</li>
 <li>Implement here strings: you can now replace <tt>print -r -- "$foo" |
  command</tt> with <tt>command &lt;&lt;&lt;"$foo"</tt> – like ksh93, zsh;
  GNU bash behaves differently if and only if $foo is not quoted</li>
 <li>Implement string replacement <tt>${var/pattern/string}</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>Especially cool feature: replace <tt>x=$(print -r -- "$x" | sed -e
 's/foo.*bar/baz/g')</tt> with <tt>x=${x//foo*bar/baz}</tt> ☺</p>
<p>Note: the distfile is not here yet, it’ll take a while to be released.
 Once it’s uploaded, the <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh homepage</a>
 will be updated with appropriate information. UPDATE: It’s out now.</p>

Title: Heads-Up: MirPorts changes
Date: 09.03.2008

<p>There is a new MirMake version, with getopt(3) changes for Darwin
 again. We do not think that this has any effect on already-built
 packages, but be careful.</p>
<p>The variables <tt>FLAVOR</tt> and <tt>FLAVORS</tt> have been
 renamed to <tt>FLAVOUR</tt> and <tt>FLAVOURS</tt>, respectively,
 to reflect correct English spelling.</p>
----
Title: New RSS feed: Developers’ Weblog (latest)
Date: 10.03.2008

<p>There is a new RSS feed which does not encode the OS version
 after which it started. You must subscribe to it manually, as
 we have no way to embed it in any header; it is implemented as
 a symbolic link to the latest respective feed:</p>
<p><a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@wlog.rss">http://www.mirbsd.org/wlog.rss</a></p>
<p>Of course, you can instead continue to use the versioned feeds.</p>

Title: MirPorts running on MidnightBSD
Date: 14.03.2008

<p>The <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@ports.htm">MirPorts Framework</a> now
 also runs on <a href="http://www.midnightbsd.org/">MidnightBSD</a>,
 in addition to MirOS BSD (native), OpenBSD (legacy), Darwin and
 Mac OSX, and Interix (in theory). Support of individual ports for
 certain operating environments may not yet be given, but the
 infrastructure already works. Sadly, systrace(1) is not part of
 the MidnightBSD base system. MirPorts work independently of the
 native mports system, do not depend on it or interfere with it,
 as usual, and can be installed per user or system-wide.</p>
----
Title: MirOS ξ relased
Date: 16.03.2008
Tag: release

<p>MirOS BSD #10 for the i386 and sparc architectures is our eleventh
 formal major release. Grab it while you can, either via the usual <a
 href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent tracker</a>, or use
 the NetInstall ISO (details on the Download page).</p>
<p>MirOS #10 focuses on Unicode support and a lot of improvements all
 over the place. The sparc platform is now fully supported again, and
 en par with i386 regarding the base system. MirOS thusly is almost a
 reference implementation of a 32-bit sparc OS now that Debian killed
 support, Gentoo wants to go that way too and the other BSDs focus on
 sparc64; and the reference implementation of XFree86® in modern open
 source OSes.</p>
<p>Read the <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@ann-10.htm">release announcement</a>,
 or the <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@clogs/">CVS ChangeLog files</a>, for more
 information on this release.</p>
<p>Note that, while a lot of virtualisation software performs quite
 well (Parallels, qemu) or works (VMware Server, bochs, MS VirtualPC,
 Xen+HVM) with MirBSD, sadly, VirtualBox doesn’t. Due to a bug in it,
 a lot of operating systems do not work.</p>
----
Title: MirOS #10 downloads
Date: 20.03.2008
Tag: release

<p>We had about 1500 downloads of the full ISO in the last 4 days,
 which is actually making our primary mirror traffic problems.</p>
<p>Please use <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent</a>
 to download the full ISO, or use <a href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/v10/cdrom10.iso">the
 NetInstall ISO</a> instead.</p>
<p>You can also switch to one of the following mirrors:</p><ul>
 <li><a href="http://pub.allbsd.org/MirOS/ISOs/MIR80316.ISO">Japan</a></li>
 <li><a href="http://server.leveldown.de/~nezza/MIR80316.ISO">Germany 2</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://www.mirbsd.org/MirOS/ISOs/MIR80316.ISO">Germany 1</a></li>
</ul>
<p id="hashes">Due to popular request: the SFV (CRC32) of the ISO is
 76D0638A, more hashes are <a href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/v10/CKSUM.gz">here</a>, and
 for these who still use the insecure MD5, 0afb38491f7557b1f7bc9ec8997ca5b4
 should matche. Note: the <tt>CKSUM.gz</tt> file hyperlinked in this
 paragraph is, of course, gzsig(1)d.</p>
<p>Note to avoid confusion: the release CD is <em>no Live CD</em>, but
 we <em>do</em> have Live CDs. However, only development snapshots are
 distributed as Live CD. It would not fit on a release CD due to the
 size of the data included, sorry.</p>
<p>We’re really surprised from the number of downloads – seems as MirOS
 has become popular. We hope that the traffic throtteling/limiting methods
 our hoster has installed on the Germany 1 mirror do not produce too much
 inconvenience for you. Thanks for using MirOS!</p>
----
Title: MirOS #10 downloads reloaded; new Errata page
Date: 24.03.2008
Tag: security

<p>After 1600+ downloads, we think it has settled down a little.
 Nevertheless, we got a request to use a new form of distribution,
 the <a href="http://www.metalinker.org/">metalinks</a>.</p>
<p>[link deleted 2014-05-13, we stopped using torrents]</p>
<p>There is also a list of <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@errata10.htm">errata
 for MirOS #10</a>; we will issue a binary update within a few days,
 as at least the Sendmail bug is severe.</p>
----
Title: MirOS #10 first binary update published
Date: 27.03.2008
Tag: security release

<p>The <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@errata10.htm#binup">Errata page</a> lists
 a binary update for the Sendmail and Apache security flaws and a
 shortcoming in the &lt;bsd.lkm.mk&gt; file. We advise to upgrade.</p>
----
Title: MirOS #10 Serial Console NetInstall ISOs available
Date: 27.03.2008
Author: tg@@
Tag: snapshot

<p>I thought these might come in handy for poor i386 users:</p><ul>
 <li><a href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/v10/cdrom10-9600,8n1.iso">COM1:9600,8,N,1</a></li>
 <li><a href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/v10/cdrom10-57600,8n1.iso">COM1:57600,8,N,1</a></li>
</ul><p>The ISOs itself (both El Torito and Live-HD/CF boot) as well as
 the included 1440 KiB Floppy images have been adjusted to automatically
 boot from serial console. To accomodate broken BIOSes (like the one from
 my VIA C7 server, or the Soekris COMBIOS), the bootloader does not wait
 for input, but instead directly boots into the kernel. This prevents you
 from using “boot -c”, but you can patch <tt>boot.cfg</tt> in the top
 directory of the ISO or floppy to achieve that.</p>
<p>Users of the sparc architecture just <tt>setenv input-device ttya</tt>
 and <tt>setenv output-device ttya</tt> instead; OpenBOOT can handle a
 serial console just fine out of the box and provides the speed as well.</p>

Title: mksh R33b, no, R33c released
Date: 28.03.2008
Author: tg@@
Tag: mksh

<p>The <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">MirBSD Korn Shell R33b</a> has just
 been released; as per the <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm#r33b">Changelog</a>
 this is a minor update: portability fixes, support for dæmonising scripts,
 and manual page improvements.</p>
<p>Online manual: <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@htman/i386/man1/mksh.htm">HTML</a>,
 <a href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/dist/mir/mksh/mksh.pdf">PDF</a> (<a
 href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-paper.html">ISO A4 paper</a>, we
 don’t support Imperial units, as even the USA has converted to Metric)</p>
<p>UPDATE 02.04.2008: <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm#r33c">mksh R33c</a> is
 out, with a bugfix and a new fully supported OS (ULTRIX 4.5).</p>

Title: mksh, mirmake, pkgtools upgraded
Date: 12.04.2008
Author: tg@@
Tag: mksh mirmake

<p>The <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">MirBSD Korn Shell R33d</a> has been
 released, mostly containing a security fix for the <tt>-T</tt> option,
 see the <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm#r33d">Changelog</a> for details.</p>
<p>A new MirMake version has been issued, to fix problems compiling C++
 code with strange file extensions (.cpp as on Microsoft® Windows®, and
 .C as BOINC uses). MirMake is a sort-of-portable version of the MirOS
 make(1) utility, a few header files and a libmirmake.a containing helper
 functions, and some supporting utilities: install(1) lndir(1) lorder(1)
 mkdep(1) readlink(1) tsort(1)</p>
<p>The MirPorts Package Tools have been updated as well, as Lucas “laffer1”
 Holt, the MidnightBSD founder, has implemented <tt>ldconfig(8) -U</tt> too,
 and the use of this option by pkg_create(1) is now required for a lot of
 packages (since GNU libiconv, expat and libpng use their own fake-pkgview

Title: ssh host key changes for anoncvs mirror [updated]
Date: 15.05.2008 15:42
Author: tg@@
Tag: security

<p>Our anoncvs mirror has changed its ssh host keys due to a Debian-specific
 problem (it's hosted on a machine running Debian GNU/Linux courtesy of
 gecko2@@). The new keys are: [Update: <i>[old broken link removed]</i> moved]</p>
<p>Please copy these into <tt>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</tt> or
 <tt>~/.etc/ssh/known_hosts</tt>, overriding the existing keys for the
 same IPs or host names.</p>
<p>The current version of the <tt>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</tt> file can be
 retrieved via anonymous CVS (from the server affected), anonymous rsync (also
 from <a href="http://www.allbsd.org/">rsync.allbsd.org</a>), CVSweb (from
 both servers) or by an eMail request.</p>
<p>Yesterday's snapshot does <em>not</em> yet include the new public host
 keys, as they were generated only today.</p>

Title: CVE-2008-1447
Date: 08.07.2008 22:19
Tag: security

<p>The <a href="http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/ticker/article.php?mid=1476">CVE-2008-1447</a>
 does not, according to various sources, affect systems that randomise
 their source port. MirOS libc’s integrated resolver, according to some
 OpenBSD developers, does this, as does DJBDNS. The net/bind mirport is
 affected, but by using pf(4) to NAT yourself (thanks to Vutral for the
 suggestion), you can randomise these ports too. According to RUS-CERT,
 only using DNSSEC is a fix… I wonder if this is truth or advertising
 for a technique without wide-spread use.</p>

Title: Bugs in the current snapshot
Date: 26.07.2008 18:42
Author: tg@@
Tag: snapshot bug

<p>The following bugs are known in the MirOS #10-current snapshot, dated
 2008-07-22:</p><ul>
 <li>The user shell for the default “live” user is <tt>/usr/dbin/mksh</tt>,
  which however has been optimised away. This is a bug in the production of
  this one snapshot and easy to fix in future issues. Workaround: while the
  rc.netselect script runs, choose ‘9’ to escape to a shell, and change the
  “live” user’s shell using vipw(8) – <tt>chsh -s /bin/mksh live</tt> might
  also work, but has not been tested.</li>
 <li>Running “startx” does not work because <tt>/usr/X11R6/bin/X</tt> is no
  symbolic link but a copy of the XFree86® server itself (on other baselive
  CDs it was a hard link instead of a copy; the change is due to production
  differences, but both break startx(1) and xinit(1)). Workaround is to use
  xdm(1) instead or try: <tt>startx -- /usr/X11R6/bin/XFree86 :0</tt></li>
 <li>The X11 server may not switch to graphics mode on the ALIX.1c board.</li>
</ul>
<p>We apologise for the inconvenience caused, and will try to solve these
 issues in the next development snapshot.</p>

Title: mksh R36 released!
Date: 25.10.2008 18:08
Author: tg@@
Tag: mksh

<p>The <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">MirBSD Korn Shell R36</a> has been
 released yesterday; the <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm#r36">Changelog</a>
 contains more details as usual.</p>
<p>Major changes:</p><ul>
 <li>Digital UNIX (DEC OSF/1) V2.0 (MIPS) is now supported using the
  DEC C and ucode toolchain. (We could not run the testsuite, though.)</li>
 <li>The ‘-Q’ option to <tt>Build.sh</tt> is gone without replacement.</li>
 <li>A new option can be enabled by adding <tt>-DMKSH_BINSHREDUCED</tt>
  to <tt>$CPPFLAGS</tt>, intended mostly for Debian. This option adds
  extra code to determine whether mksh(1) is called as <tt>sh</tt> or
  <tt>-sh</tt> and switch to “set -o posix” mode if so, disabling brace
  expansion and some security features, because legacy scripts, such as
  debconf, depend on such reduced functionality <tt>/bin/sh</tt>s.</li>
 <li>Input lines beginning with an IFS character of IFS white space are
  no longer pushed into the history. Some other, less surprising, changes
  were also made to both Emacs and Vi command line editing modes.</li>
 <li>The <tt>arc4random.c</tt> contributed file is now stored with the
  RCS version number appended, and has been updated.</li>
</ul><p>This is a major update with improved stability and compatibility,
 and as such recommended in general. It has undergone more extensive
 testing than mksh R35; if there still be bugs, please report to us.
 Note that some sorts of behaviour are not considered bugs but expected,
 sometimes due to historical, sometimes compatibility reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Request for Assistance:</strong> We are still looking for an
 OpenBSD committer to import mksh into the ports tree. Furthermore, a
 Slackware GNU/Linux package is still missing, as well as a PC-BSD PBI,
 and Macports (former Darwinports) do not carry mksh either. My earlier
 <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@permalinks/wlog-10_e20081021-tg-g10008.htm">Minix

Title: paxmirabilis-20081030 (MirCPIO) released
Date: 29.10.2008 18:31
Author: tg@@
Tag: cpio

<p><tt>RMD160 (<a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@MirOS/dist/mir/cpio/paxmirabilis-20081030.cpio.gz">paxmirabilis-20081030.cpio.gz</a>) = 34c9a5913c9e69c8451d27d6ceeaa07cce6d3fef</tt></p>
<p>Everyone who has been using the portable version of the MirBSD cpio(1),
 pax(1), tar(1) combined utility should upgrade, as the new version not
 only allows the executables to be called, for example, <tt>mirtar</tt>
 (to avoid breaking tools such as dpkg-source and lintian when they are
 in the <tt>$PATH</tt>), but also contains fixes regarding certain types
 of broken archives, such as these found in the Fedora Core 4 RPMs, which
 do not store the data content of hard-linked files packed with the first
 archive member but a later (the last). Furthermore, the ‘-v’ option may
 now be given multiple times to the cpio and pax, not only tar, frontend.</p>
<p>paxmirabilis is used, among others, in MirOS BSD, the MirPorts Framework,
 FreeWRT Embedded GNU/Linux ADK.</p>

Title: MirOS #10-current (i386, sparc) 2008-10-30 snapshot published
Date: 30.10.2008 18:42
Author: tg@@
Tag: snapshot

<p>Today, a new snapshot of MirOS-current has been uploaded into the <a
 href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@MirOS/current/">NetInstall</a> area. The <tt>cdrom10.iso</tt>
 image is, as usually, a manifold-boot ISO 9660 filesystem which starts
 on i386 via El Torito, on i386 via MBR (if dd(1)’d onto a hard disc,
 USB stick, CompactFlash card, etc.), and on sparc via OpenBOOT. It also
 contains floppy images for i386 (one normal and three for serial console
 at COM1/tty00 at 9600, 38400 and 115200 bps, 8N1) and sparc. There are
 also CD images for serial console boot with the same parametres.</p>
<p>The MirPorts Framework snapshot, <tt>ports10.ngz</tt>, has also been
 updated. Note that we are still seeking port maintainers (our current
 policy is to update ports we use, which are often used, or we notice,
 or these someone asks us to, because we are understaffed), as well as
 people who use the MirPorts Framework on MidnightBSD and OpenBSD (and,
 to a lesser extend, Mac OSX). Furthermore, the <tt>pkgsrc10.ngz</tt>
 snapshot has been untouched since July 2007; if someone would like to
 improve the situation, for example by talking to the pkgsrc® developers
 responsible for stalling the integration, talk to ahoka@@ (replaced in
 <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@irc.htm">IRC</a>).</p>
<p>This snapshot does not come as a DuaLive CD due to issues with both
 J�rg Schilling’s mkisofs(﻿8), which has since been removed from
 the base system source tree, and NetBSD® makefs(8). However, we are
 trying to solve these and will produce one as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As of now, there are no binary packages compiled specifically for
 this snapshot; however, binary packages for older snapshots and even
 MirOS #10 RELEASE generally work.</p>

Tag: snapshot

<p>The <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@bt.htm#s81106">2008-11-06</a> snapshot of
 MirOS BSD/i386 #10-current has been released as a new-style dualive CD

<p>We are proud to announce the migration of the httpd(8) vhost
 <tt>www.mirbsd.org</tt> to <tt>eurynome</tt>, the VM already mentioned
 in the Developers’ Weblog. The MirOS website is now accessible <a

 in a secure fashion), using IPv4 or IPv6. Due to no longer being hosted
 on a foreign operating system, operation should be much more smooth.
 CVSweb, AnonCVS and AnonRSYNC are now provided from a central place,
 and you can even retrieve the full website via rsync.</p>
<p>The links in the <tt>mirbsd.de</tt> Zope kindly hosted by waldi also
 have been changed to use SSL now.</p>
<p>All links to the <tt>66h.42h.de</tt> domain have also been changed to
 point to <tt>mirbsd.de</tt> or <tt>mirbsd.org</tt>, as the latter is now
 under sort of our control, and the former being phased out to reduce the

Title: MirOS Licence got OSI blessing
Date: 14.11.2008

<p>The <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@MirOS-Licence">MirOS Licence</a> is now, after
 quite some years, <a href="http://opensource.org/">OSI</a> approved, which
 not only implies an official certification that it conforms to the Open
 Source Definition, but also allows <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh</a>
 to be advertised as “OSI Certified Open Source Software”™, and has other
 benefits, for example qualifying for being hosted by certain projects, or
 fulfilling certain gouvernment restrictions.</p>
<p>While there has always been cōnsensus that The MirOS Licence is <a
 href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">DFSG</a> and <a
 href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd">OSD</a> and, recently, <a
 href="http://www.opendefinition.org/1.0">OKD</a> conformant, only <a
 href="http://www.ifross.de/ifross_html/lizenzcenter.html">some</a> lists
 actually included it – <a href="http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses">the
 OKFN</a> was quick to do so, but while it qualifies as both <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a> and <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html">Free Documentation</a>
 licence as per the FSF definition, they have yet to respond to my enquiry,
 and the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/miros.html">OSI list</a>
 has only been updated last night (and could use some UTF-8 fixing, or, in
 this case certainly better, a downgrade to the ASCII version dubbed the <a
 href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@cvs.cgi/src/share/misc/licence.template?rev=HEAD;content-type=text/plain">licence
 template</a> initially).</p>
<p>Still we’re glad that the OSI, although not encouraging people to actually
 <em>use</em> the licence, given their stance on “licence proliferation”, has
 done this step. It would be the first approved “copycenter” (as per Marshall
 Kirk McKusick’s definition) style licence with EU jurisdiction in mind while
 remaining generally usable.</p>

Title: pcc cpp imported, Reiser CCCP dropped
Date: 18.11.2008 21:30
Tag: pcc

<p>The C Præprocessor, cpp(1), in MirOS-current has changed.</p>
<p><tt>/usr/bin/cpp</tt> is henceforth deprecated in MirOS-current as well as
 in MirOS-stable; it’s a shell script (overhead!) to call either mcpp(1) or
 Reiser CCCP. It will be removed in MirOS-current ASAP.</p>
<p><tt>/usr/bin/mcpp</tt> calls GNU cpp directly. Its manual page used to be
 called cpp(1) and is now called mcpp(1). Since we are going towards a multi
 compiler system, people are expected to use “${CC} -E” as C Præprocessor in
 the future, instead of relying on an external cpp binary, when compiling. A
 cpp binary will still be provided for the X(7) Windowing System and similar
 uses. <tt>/usr/bin/mcpp</tt> will be removed some time before MirOS #11</p>
<p><tt>/usr/libexec/cpp</tt> used to be Reiser CCCP without a manual page.
 It is now pcc cpp(1) with a manual page.</p>
<p>ahoka@@ came up with the idea of using the (much faster) pcc cpp over the
 (rather slow) GNU cpp for purposes like Xresources, xdm configuration files,
 etc. Reiser CCCP could be used too, but it’s lacking in terms of standards
 and features. However, pcc cpp is under the Caldera licence, and thus, the
 following text must be reproduced in this announcement. (It’s still much
 more free than GNU cpp.)</p>
<p style="font-size:small;">This product includes software developed or
 owned by Caldera International, Inc.</p>
<p>Technical issues: pcc cpp uses getopt(3) and, as such, has a command line
 syntax which is <em>totally different</em> from the CPP standard. It also
 pre-defines neither <em>any</em> macros nor include paths. Be warned, and
 expect some breakage until everything is sorted out.</p>

Title: HEADS-UP for MirOS-current

<p>If you want to track MirOS-current, be aware that <tt>/usr/libexec/cpp</tt>
 changed and <tt>/usr/bin/cpp</tt> is gone; you <strong>must</strong> compile
 and install a new <tt>cpp</tt> first, then stuff like rpcgen(1) and lint(1),
 then remove the <tt>/usr/bin/cpp</tt> script.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the gcc-provided shared libraries and items have moved from
 <tt>/usr/lib</tt> to <tt>/usr/lib/gcc/<i>OStriplet</i>/3.4.6</tt> which you
 should add to <tt>shlib_dirs</tt> in <tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt> until you
 have rebuilt everything (base system and ports). Both mgcc and llvm-gcc add
 appropriate DT_RPATH to programs and shared objects compiled with them and
 use their own crtstuff; <tt>mircvs://src/lib/csu/</tt> now provides crtstuff
 for use with <em>pcc</em>(!) instead.</p>
<p>Expect a new i386 snapshot some time soon; sparc snapshots are planned
 more for the long term but could be compiled on request (ETA one week).</p>

Title: Cool i386 bootloader changes

<p>The second-stage boot(8/i386) loader has gained several interesting new
 features:</p><ul>
<li>When called as DOS .com program, it defaults to DL=80h because no
 actual drive is passed from the BIOS</li>
<li>When named <tt>boot.com</tt> it can be run as SYSLINUX (ISOLINUX,
 PXELINUX, EXTLINUX) module and boot any OpenBSD/i386 and MirBSD/i386
 kernels from local filesystems supported</li>
<li>In addition to 4.2FFS and ISO 9660, the code to support the FAT12,
 FAT16, and FAT28 filesystems works and is enabled now, for both booting
 and the “ls” command</li>
<li>If a hard disc has no type 27h partition, the disklabel is searched
 using the superfloppy approach (i.e., LBA sector #1)</li>
<li>If no disklabel can be found, one is spoofed with a somewhat
 reasonable ‘c’ slice, the four MBR primary partitions as slices ‘d’,
 ‘e’, ‘f’ and ‘g’, and an ‘a’ slice spanning either the partition passed
 from <tt>DS:SI</tt> via SYSLINUX, the first non-empty MBR partition, or
 the entire disc</li>
<li>The new command “cat” allows you to display files from within the
 bootloader, lest they be accessible</li>
<li>The new command “machine label [hd0a]” dumps the disklabel</li>
<li>You can place more than one command on the same input line, because
 ‘`’ now acts the same as ‘\n’ in the command parser; this is useful for
 instance if the serial console is not accessible from the boot loader,
 but required for the kernel, and using a <tt>boot.cfg</tt> is no option</li>
</ul>
<p>The <tt>/usr/mdec/mbrldr</tt>, <tt>/usr/mdec/mbrmgr</tt> and the MBR
 built in fdisk(8/i386) have been upgraded to pass the partition data
 in <tt>DS:SI</tt> (or junk if reading from FDD or whole HDD)</p>
<p>*smile* Now we just need to make our bootloader multiboot-compliant…</p>

Title: New allegiances for mksh &#38; Co.
Tag: grml mksh snapshot

<p><a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh</a> formed new allegiances: the

 (10x <a href="http://www.feyrer.de/NetBSD/blog.html/nb_20081229_2302.html">hubertf@@TNF</a>
 for mentioning) has added mksh(1) today, and the latest project of
 CcSsNET, CcSsLIVE (broken link removed 20100916), will include
 it soonish as well. Nicely, he already links to MirBSD, for he sits
 in our <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@irc.htm">IRC</a> channel usually and is
 one of the sparc users.</p>
<p>The next version of <a href="http://grml.org/">grml GNU/Linux</a>
 might very well come not just with mksh(1) (except grml-small), but
 also with <tt>bootbsd.com</tt> née boot(8/i386) and <tt>bsd.rd</tt>
 (a slightly “tuned” version with added <tt>e3</tt> editor and sans
 the Install/Upgrade/Shell prompt). On the contrary, I’m toying with
 the idea of adding a <tt>ports/sysutils/pxegrub</tt> for local boot
 along with a slightly tuned (add <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh</a>
 at the very least) on the DuaLive ISOs if I find we have the space.
 We’ll have to work out something, licence and GPL-source-requirement
 wise, but we’re positive this would work out well. Considering just
 <em>how</em> good of a rescue system our <tt>bsd.rd</tt> kernel is,
 already, and what added benefit a minimal pretty standard Live Linux
 may provide.</p>

Title: MirOS #10/i386 binary packages problems

<p>It has come to our attention that a good share of the available <a
 href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/Pkgs/v10/i386/">binary packages</a> for the
 last stable version have actually been accidentally built against a
 (very old) version of MirOS #10-current, thus demanding slightly newer
 libraries. We estimate this problem being resolved when the next batch
 of binary packages for #10-stable is built, although there is none
 scheduled as of yet, and a run for #10-current will probablt precede
 it. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>An analysis of the code in question however shows that it is almost
 certain to be safe – for the purpose of running the aforementioned
 binary packages <strong>only</strong> – to rename <tt>libc.so.41.0</tt>
 to <tt>libc.so.41.1</tt> to quell the warning encountered (or one of
 them, possibly, but the most frequent one at that). The addition of
 functions was almost certainly not relevant for MirPorts use.</p>
<p>We apologise about the inconvenience. If you run into any problems,
 please contact us on <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@irc.htm">IRC</a> or via the <a

Title: Bug in Parallels Desktop found ⇒ no longer supported [updated]
Date: 26.01.2009 22:35
Author: tg@@
Tag: bug snapshot

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">Benny, read below before killing me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-0706.htm">AH=41h INT 13h</a>
 is a function with which one can ask a BIOS if it supports LBA on a
 specific drive or not. The El Torito bootable CDs only function with
 LBA (EDD). A <a href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/ISOs/LBATEST.ISO.gz">gzipped
 LBA test ISO</a> is available for you to check your BIOS against it;
 I had not yet come across one which does not report it correctly.</p>
<p>Our new bootloader, instead of having separate copies for network
 boot, CD-ROMs, floppies and hard discs, asks the BIOS what type drive
 it is running on (both first and second stage). If we were to remove
 the check if LBA is supported on the boot drive from the first stage
 bootloader (the PBR, <tt>bootxx</tt>), it would no longer work on MFM
 HDDs, floppies, etc; besides, the second stage boot(8/i386) loader is
 still using it to distinguish CDs from hard discs.</p>
<p>Anyway: the Parallels BIOS fails the EDD installation check and, as
 such, does not conform to the El Torito standard. Our new bootloader
 just happens to expose that problem – try the ISO for yourself…</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@pics/wlog/lbapdsk.png">Parallels BUGstop</a></li>
 <li><a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@pics/wlog/lbaqemu.png">qemu 0.7.2 DTRT</a> (for
  once…)</li>
</ul>
<p>We hereby cease to support working around the brokenness in order
 to use one unified second stage boot(8) loader per platform for both
 local (HDD, CD) and network boot. Parallels should fix their BIOS.</p>
<p>As <strong>workaround</strong> you can make use of the functionality
 that MirOS ISOs can be dd(1)d to a hard disc and run from there. Just
 enter it as an additional hard disc drive instead of CD-ROM drive. Or
 use netboot (load b_i386.ldr and the bsd.rd kernel).</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> 31.01: <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@permalinks/wlog-10_e20090131-tg.htm">tg@@
 has hacked a workaround</a> &ndash; reporting this bug to Parallels is

Title: FOSDEM 2009 ISO erratum: i386 does not boot after HDD installation
Date: 08.02.2009 21:07
Author: tg@@
Tag: bug event snapshot

<p>Due to bug-hiding circumstances, this problem was only identified
 during FOSDEM Sunday afternoon. The first stage boot loader would
 overwrite itself trying to load the second stage boot loader, due to
 them sharing the same 16-bit (64 KiB) segment after the workaround
 for the <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@permalinks/news_e20090126-tg.htm">Parallels bug</a>.
 installboot(8/i386) would pass the sectors covered by filesystem
 blocks, which amounts up to multiples of 8 or 16 KiB, even though
 the last block was not entirely filled. Fix is to do bounds checking
 in the assembly code at boot time.</p>
<p>An <a href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/current/older/i386/fixes10.ngz">updated
 <tt>fixes</tt> dist set</a> is available for people doing a network
 installation anyway, or to extract later with<br />
 <tt>$ cd /</tt><br />
 <tt>$ sudo tar xzphvvf <em>/path/to/</em>fixes10.ngz</tt></p>
<p class="boxhead">If you do a CD installation, you have

 set from network after finishing a disc installation, before the
 installboot(8/i386) part is run. Of course, you can substitute
 <strong>shttp</strong> with <strong>http</strong> too or specify
 a proxy to use.</p>
<p>If you have already installed, follow the above mentioned tar
 command to unpack the <tt>fixes</tt> set (in <tt>/mnt</tt> if
 you are still in the installer), then use the command:<br />

 <br />(<em>wd0</em> or <em>sd0</em> depending on which is your root
 disc; the second line is for within the installer)</p>
<p>My (tg@@) sincerest apologies for this bug, which was introduced during
 the Parallels Desktop BIOS bug workaround’s creation. Remember, if you
 already have an (unbootable) installation, you can do all this by booting
 from the CD again (into the installer/rescue kernel).</p>

Title: [current] /usr/dbin and /usr/dsbin removed

<p>With sincere apologies to Han Boetes, the dynamically linked copies of
 the system binaries have been removed from the system due to performance
 and manageability issues. For the <tt>sysutils/fakeroot</tt> port, there
 is a documented way to recompile these yourself, dynamically linked; you
 <strong>better be sure</strong> to only do that if <tt>/usr</tt> isn’t a
 separate filesystem, because otherwise, the programs will be unable to
 find the dynamic link libraries or interpreter.</p>
<p>During an upgrade to the next snapshot, the files in these directories
 will be replaced by symbolic links. However, it is usually not instantly
 safe to remove them, because, for example, the <tt>/etc</tt> scripts use
 them, your user shell will be <tt>/usr/dbin/mksh</tt>, and the likes. So
 be careful wrt that directory. – A fresh MirOS installation however will
 no longer contain it.</p>

<p>The new ‘-combine’ <tt>Build.sh</tt> option (gcc4 only) is about as

 now much more standards compliant, especially wrt. “set -e”.</p>
<p>As such, mksh R37b is a strongly suggested upgrade.</p>
<p>Note: Freshmeat has a new website. I am utterly confused from it,

<p><a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@permalinks/news_e20090411-tg.htm">Yesterday’s
 snapshot</a> has been amended with new kernels (<tt>bsd</tt> plus

Title: RELIABILITY ADVISORY – [#8, #9, #10, -current] ext2fs support
Tag: bug

<p>MirOS #10-current: support code for 256 byte inodes has been
 reverted (backed out) due to regressions wrt. 128 byte inode
 filesystems.</p>
<p><strong>MirOS #8, #9, #10, #10-current:</strong> It is advised
 to <span class="u">refrain from using the
 <tt>ext2fs</tt> filesystem</span>, especially in read-write mode,
 because symlink code is broken. The filesystem, and all processes
 accessing it, become unresponsive (hang in D state) upon creation
 of a symbolic link or access of a filesystem where such a broken
 symlink(7) is created. MirOS #7 can be used to access filesystems
 such as these, but the broken symlinks can still not be accessed
 by penalty of a kernel panic(9).</p>
<p>MirOS #10-current: ext2fs will be mounted read-only by default
 for now, starting 2009-04-23, until these problems are fixed.</p>
<p>MirOS (recent but unknown versions): the <tt>async</tt> mount
 flag ceased to work as it did before, says bsiegert@@</p>

Title: mksh semantical change for string length and substring expansion
Tag: mksh

<p><a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh</a> semantics for evaluating
 substring expansion <tt>${strvar:pos:len}</tt> and string length
 <tt>${#strvar}</tt> expressions has changed today. These operations
 now work on characters, not on bytes. Characters are octets in
 non-UTFMODE (which is pretty much the same as bytes, because mksh(1)
 is a BSD application and, as per style(9), allowed to assume certain
 things about the environment) and MirOS OPTU-8 multibyte character
 sequences in <tt>utf8-mode</tt>.</p>
<p>This means things like <tt>typeset -Uui16 -Z7 wc=1#${str::1}</tt>
 now do the right thing (getting you the MirOS OPTU-16 wide character
 value of the first character in the <tt>str</tt>).</p>

Title: /dev/arandom passes ports/math/ent and dieharder_2.28.1-3_i386.deb
Date: 20.08.2009 15:32
Author: tg@@

<p>arandom(4) is a high quality SRNG (stretched RNG). It passes these
 test suites quite well on bleu (IBM X40, without TPM support). I also
 took 128 MiB samples from the same <tt>/dev/arandom</tt>, as well as
 from tear (Via C7), herc (P-233MMX), ss5, eurynome. The results are
 similar to each other (some of the tests rewind the input file a lot
 of times, so there are of course differences to the test using the
 arandom(4) stream directly – but the results are as good as can be
 expected, and tests that happen to fail (which is expected too, as
 it’s random after all) pass quite well with other runs). Another 128
 MiB snippet of the TPM output looks to be as good as the arandom one,
 which doesn’t infer that it’s a TRNG, but it’ll at least help; the
 C7 xstore-rng output however looks rather bad in some tests (such as
 the Chi square test); apparently, the kernel initialises it with not
 optimum values (which <em>may</em> even be correct, as we use the RNG
 from kernel space, so a bias doesn’t matter, whereas Von Neumann bias
 correction would eat up very many bits; additionally, it’s designed
 to work from VIA C3 onwards).</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://marc.info/?m=125058382706316">the Entropy
 Key</a> will have even better results. It’s still a thermal noise
 (or Johnson noise?) type, not a “real” QRNG (using photons and a
 mirror, or radioactive material and a Geiger counter), unless the
 one from fourmilab.ch (I’d insert a link here, but John Walker’s
 site appears to be down). Personally, I use the use-many-sources
 and mix approach, getting “best” entropy from external sources,
 including fourmilab’s (via https), “good” from myself (VIA C7,
 IBM TPM, soon eKey); “medium”, “regular” and “bad” from myself,
 where most of these are non-interceptible – the RANDOM.SYS for DOS
 author says every bit counts, and I think so too. cprng(8) is an
 example of “medium” (or “bad” if you lack the appropriate hardware)
 source; keyboard/mouse are “regular”, disc/net I/O are “bad” but
 available. The four-pool mixing helps, and the results show. Hell,
 even <tt>nwt</tt> has good entropy. And the RANDEX protocol helps
 some, too. Untrusted, but potentially good bits; wrandom(4) pool.</p>

Title: New MirMake (mandatory update)

Tag: bug mksh

<p class="boxhead">Due to a bug <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm#clog">mksh
 fixed</a> after inheriting it from pdksh via OpenBSD ksh (oksh), which
 probably got it from AT&amp;T ksh88 (ksh93 exhibits the correct behaviour,
 as does posh), coupled with the unfortunate lines</p>
<div class="boxtext"><pre>
	CC=${CC:Q} ${MKDEP_SH} -a ${MKDEP} ${CFLAGS:M-[ID]*} \
	    ${CPPFLAGS} $$files; \
</pre></div><p class="boxfoot">in <tt>&lt;bsd.dep.mk</tt>, where ${MKDEP}
 can be the mkdep(1) option <tt>-p</tt> as well as additional CPPFLAGS like
 <tt>-I...</tt> (which I actually found in our tree), you <strong>absolutely
 must</strong> upgrade your MirMake package, as well as mkdep(1) in the base
 system, <em>before</em> upgrading to mksh-20091015 or newer. (Note that R40,
 which will carry the breaking fix, has not been released yet, but FreeWRT
 uses an mksh-current snapshot bearing it with still major 39 enacted.) It is
 actually pretty hard to work around, see the mkdep source code for details.
 There are basically two things to take care of:</p><ul>
 <li>For each <i>x</i> in <tt>getopts "...x..." c</tt>, make sure you not
  only case <tt>(x) ... ;;</tt> but also either case <tt>(+x) ... ;;</tt>
  or have a <tt>(*) ... ;;</tt> default trailing block, because mksh(1)
  getopts will also catch <tt>foo -x +y -z</tt> sanely. This is, in contrast
  to oksh, not disablable with a shell option.</li>
 <li>If you case <tt>(\?) <i>cmds</i> ;;</tt> (either explicitly or via a
  default block), <strong>special rules</strong> apply: if you do anything
  other than exiting from there (e.g. via <i>usage</i>), <tt>$OPTIND</tt>
  will differ: newer shells <em>count</em> this option, olders don't.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new distfile {RMD160 (/MirOS/dist/mir/make/mirmake-20091020.cpio.gz)
 = b9ac1258bc66b3d0d63537cc82d02c91408d1ba8} has been uploaded for your
 convenience already and will be integrated (after testing) into both The
 MirPorts Framework and FreeWRT as
 soon as we get to it, probably tomorrow.</p>

<h3 class="revbox">@@!PICTURE0!@@</h3>
<pre>Gee...  I don’t know what “hallowe’en” means…</pre>
<p>Does this match what you’re thinking? Well, there <em>is</em> a new
 MirOS snapshot, with several components, (as usual) out on <a
 href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@bt.htm#s91031">BitTorrent</a>. It was also distributed on
 CDs at OpenRheinRuhr 2009, and will be (by formorer) at 26C3 in Berlin.</p>
<p>This is the combination of an ISO 9660 filesystem image with the
 “Samhain” edition of MirBSD and the “Hello, Wien!” edition of <a
 href="http://grml.org/2009/10/31/">grml GNU/Linux</a>, Triforce (as
 usual), and the „Allerheiligen“ CVS snapshot. And a tribute to UF.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> 01.11. – This is tagged 「event」 because I
 intend on distributing this snapshot on CDs at <a
 href="http://openrheinruhr.de/">OpenRheinRuhr</a> next weekend, and
 maybe Benny on bootable tapes at 26C3…</p>
<h3 class="revbox">@@!PICTURE1!@@</h3>
<p>MirGRML 2009.10 is based on grml-small 2009.10-rc3 and contains a
 couple more programs, and, as usual, is fitted to match the rest
 of The MirOS Project’s offers, for instance by not using a framebuffer
 by default, having <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh</a> as login
 shell, etc.<br />This time, all (required) source code is available
 either from our CVS or from <tt>sources.grml.org</tt>.</p>
<p>The Squash-and-Steffl background comes from Christoph Prokop, and
 was used in our desktop wallpaper with permission from Mika.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> 01.11. – The GRUB2 「memtest86+」 bootmenu
 option does not work because nobody told the Grml team that it must
 now be booted with 「linux16」 ipv 「linux」 – fix is to type ‘e’ to
 edit the entry, move right, type the “16” and hit ^X to boot.</p>
<p>Note: This is “MirGRML”, a mini-Grml coming with MirBSD. There is
 also “MirOS bsd4grml”, a mini-MirBSD coming with Grml. This should
 clear up any possible confusion. (This snapshot contains a full MirOS
 BSD, i386 and sparc, <em>no</em> MirOS bsd4grml, plus MirGRML, but
 <em>no</em> Grml. The Grml 2009.10 release contains a full/medium/small
 Grml, <em>no</em> MirGRML, plus MirOS bsd4grml (the small one).</p>
<h3 class="revbox">@@!PICTURE2!@@</h3>
<p>MirOS BSD, both i486 and sparc architectures. Most recent snapshot,
 compiled 2009-10-30, with an updated kernel for a <strong>security
 fix</strong> from 2009-10-31 we <em>urge</em> people to upgrade to,
 even if running older versions. Hence, MirOS-current snapshots are
 now recommended over MirOS #10-RELEASE, updates for which we have
 been unable to provide regularily due to lack of time. (Sorry.) This
 snapshot could have been released as MirOS #11 if it were not for our
 release plans (so please consider it a new stable release, albeit one
 without intentions to release binary incremental security updates, but
 then, we can’t do so for #10 either, so you still win).</p>
<p>MirBSD/i386 is called MirOS BSD/i486 above. We <em>might</em> produce
 a MirOS BSD/i386 platform with user-space soft-float (like ARM), for a
 SoC device, if we want and have the time to play with such platforms.
 What is currently MirBSD/i386 requires an Intel 80486DX or compatible,
 such as a Cyrix 80486DLC (the one in <tt>nwt</tt>, see my wlog entries
 for details). Neither 80386 compatibles nor FPU-less systems will work
 with this release.<br />MirBSD/sparc is still compiled for v8 CPUs, with
 optimisation for HyperSPARC turned on. It is possible to compile your
 own variant for a v7 CPU (sun4 or sun4c system), though.</p>
<p>This Live CD comes with IceWM, Dillo 2 and a couple of other tools
 installed and partially preconfigured (you can even run MirBSD inside
 MirBSD, as qemu is shipped). Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> 02.11. – The <tt>/etc/rc</tt> shipped breaks
 pflogd(8) and hence spamlogd(8) – part of the spamd(8) suite – please
 update this file from the <tt>etc10.ngz</tt> set manually to cvs(1) <a
 href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@cvs.cgi/src/etc/rc.diff?r1=1.105;r2=1.107">revision
 1.107</a> if you are running a spamfilter scenario. Our apologies.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> 08.11. – Append the following line:
 <tt>CHARACTER_SET:utf-8</tt> to <tt>/etc/lynx.cfg</tt> or re-enable
 locale-based charset setting.</p>
<h3 class="revbox">@@!PICTURE3!@@</h3>
<p>Once this release is done, I will create a cpio-with-crc-ball of the
 CVS repository again, for initial extraction purposes, to speed up an
 rsync mirror process. It will be available from our usual web mirrors.
</p>
<p>You can also pull <tt>/cvs</tt> directly, and <tt>/MirOS</tt> and
 <tt>/Pkgs</tt>. We plan to make <em>all</em> distfiles used to build
 MirPorts packages available as well, but currently lack disc space on
 some of the boxen involved (they are still usually available from the
 original mirrors, as well as on request directly from bsiegert@@/tg@@,
 plus we fully intend on making binary packages the viable option).</p>

 been released. This is a must-upgrade, a major <em>everything</em> version.
 See the <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm#r40">changelog</a> for now, until <a
 href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm#c40">caveats</a> are filled in, due to the sheer
 amount of changes. The diff between the last and the new release is more
 than half of the last release’s size, after all – it’s been 15½ months.</p>
<p>The plan for the next two releases is:</p><ul>
 <li>mksh R41 will fix all bugs popping up within the next few weeks, as
  they usually show up shortly after a release only, when things are getting
  adopted. Furthermore, it removes deprecated code that emits a warning in
  R40: several <tt>Build.sh</tt> options, plus <tt>set ±o arc4random</tt>.
  Finally, I plan on speed-up for arrays by using hashtables internally.</li>
 <li>mksh R42 is where we tentatively target associative arrays for, now.
  Multidimensional arrays should be introduced at the same time.</li>
</ul>

Title: State of the Art (MirBSD-current snapshot)
Tag: snapshot

<p>The current “state of the art” in MirBSD land was just uploaded. This
 snapshot carries a new patchlevel to show that things happened, such as
 a bootloader fix for systems with more than one hard disc; but be aware
 we’re not yet finished with all we think must be done. – The entropyKey
 software stack has been updated, by the way, and tg@@’s shiny new second
 stick was inaugurated during this build, so it contains Moarrr Entropy™
 in addition to e.g. the mksh(1) fix noted on the mailing list.</p>
<p>The MirOS infrastructure servers will be upgraded to patchlevel 10uB0
 shortly.</p>

Title: mksh R42b and R41c released
Date: 15.02.2013
Author: tg@@
Tag: mksh

<p>The <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">MirBSD Korn Shell</a> must-have
 bugfix releases R42b (for the current formal release series) and
 R41c (for the last bugfix-only stable series) have been issued.
 Debian testing/unstable users get the fixes through their package
 management, versioned 40.9.20120630-7 targetting wheezy (hopefully).
 Debian experimental users will receive a 42b-1 upload, closer to
 what other distro packages provide, soonish, targetting jessie.</p>
<p>Since we lack anything better (that, unless Freshmeat, is actually
 usable), by request of our packagers, new mksh(1) releases will be
 announced on our <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@rss.htm">miros-mksh@@ mailing
 list</a> starting now.</p>

Title: Rolling is the new buzzword
Tag: snapshot

<p>The MirOS Project is proud to announce that the <a
 href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/current/">NetInstall area</a> contains
 a fresh snapshot of MirBSD-current for the i386 and sparc
 architectures. In due time, a hand-crafted Live ISO image,
 with some packages configured and grml-mir added, will be
 published here, so watch this space ;-)</p>
<p>As someone in <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@irc.htm">IRC</a> already
 mentioned, MirBSD is currently published on a “rolling release”
 schedule (although we’ll eventually release MirBSD #11… some
 day). The snapshots are intended mainly for people to use when
 installing, or trying out MirBSD, but also as an upgrade aid
 (so recompiling afterwards (to be even more up to date) is
 very easy) and a baseline for binary packages (although there
 have been few (though MuPDF is a recent noteworthy addition)
 MirPorts packages lately, and I somehow doubt bsiegert@@ wants
 me to gift one of my SPARCstation boxen to him for building
 pkgsrc® quarterlies).</p>

Title: Warning about regression in mksh-current
Tag: mksh

<p><a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm#clog">mksh-current</a> version
 <tt>"R48 2013/11/17"</tt> (only this version, no others) suffer
 from a now-known regression which can make your MirBSD system
 unbootable. Please immediately either revert to an earlier version
 (such as a stable release)
 or update to <tt>"R48 2013/11/29"</tt> from AnonCVS.</p>
<p>This reverts the fix for “x="X 1 2"; showargs ${x#X}”, which
 nevertheless is a genuine bug. Contributions fixing it without
 introducing any such regressions welcome…</p>

Title: Server and service moves
Tag: snapshot

<p>I’m currently moving servers and services, and have just
 installed MirBSD natively on the new <tt>www</tt>-to-be,
 <tt>fish</tt> (part of FreeWRT’s legacy). This means that
 some services will be temporarily unavailable in the days
 (*cough*) to come. Also, we will temporarily be restricted
 to Legacy IP availability, losing IP connectivity until I
 manage to set up a tunnel at the new location. Sorry for
 doing this “at the last minute” but it’s an involved process.
 On the other hand, I <em>did</em> already get a new SSL
 certificate for <tt>www.mirbsd.org</tt> (from Startcom),
 and begun operating a MirBSD CA (for the forth time) for
 all our other X.509 needs (mostly, server-to-server SSL
 connections including auth’d SMTP relaying).</p>
<p>In true “rolling release” fashion, there is a new MirBSD
 snapshot for the i386 architecture available in the usual <a
 href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/current/">netinstall location</a>.
 I removed all <a href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/Pkgs/current/">MirPorts
 binary packages</a> for previous snapshots, since there were
 quite some changes (libc major bump, C++ removal, etc.) in
 base in the meantime. (Expect some fallout. I just realised
 I cancelled the Manitu server (for monetary reasons), which
 is blazingly fast, before I was able to finish doing a usable
 G++ 4.4 port…)</p>

Title: mksh R51 released, plans for R52 and R50g
Date: 10.07.2015
Author: tg@@
Tag: mksh pcli

<p>The <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">MirBSD Korn Shell</a> R51
 was published today. This is a feature release clearly, but
 still something a lot of people would wish to use. It contains
 several known severe bugs, but they all are no regressions,
 i.e. they exist in R50f already.</p>
<p>This one is kinda an early release, as I wish to have those
 known issues all fixed, but the changes – both deep down and
 enduser-visible – already warrant people looking for breakages,
 plus it makes synchronisation with mksh-os2 easier.</p>
<p>mksh R52 will follow, as bugfix release, pretty soon. Itinerary:</p><ul>
 <li>Fixes for as much of these known bugs as possible (code rewrites)</li>
 <li>Unicode 8</li>
 <li>New feature: <tt>print -a</tt></li>
 <li>Fixes for bugs reported against R51</li>
 <li>Possibly more EBCDIC and OS/2 code synchronisation</li>
 <li>Maybe a dead useful debug tool…</li>
</ul>
<p>Once that’s out, I’ll roll up the fixes into R50g, so that
 particular code branch is not dead yet either ☺</p>
<p>And afterwards, at least mksh(1)-wise – I have got a lot of other
 things on my plate after all – we can attempt getting EBCDIC and
 maybe OS/2 to a state where the code is included in CVS.</p>

Title: mksh R52 released
Date: 12.12.2015 23:39
Author: tg@@
Tag: mksh pcli

<p>The <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">MirBSD Korn Shell</a> R52
 was published today. While there are still several known bugs,
 this is a release that primarily fixes lots of these, and, as
 with R51, we have no known regressions. Some of the itinerary
 for R52 has moved to R53 instead, as some bugfixes change the
 shell language and thus warrant a new major version, which is
 why this is not R51b, and they accumulated and could use some
 testing ;-)</p>
<p>This release has a nōnzero chance to break existing scripts
 that use some extension features – I had to quote some tildes
 in <tt>dot.mkshrc</tt> and a variable expansion in ${x/y"$z"}
 in MirWebseite (the <tt>$z</tt>) – <em>twice</em>!. As usual,
 test!</p>
<p>In less related news, a new release of the <a
 href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/dist/mir/Foundry/"><tt>FixedMisc [MirOS]</tt>
 font</a> is available (in BDF form and no conflict with the
 system <tt>Fixed [Misc]</tt> font); our CVS has the <a

Title: POSIX locales; POSIX shell and `…` command substitutions
Date: 02.01.2016 21:01
Author: tg@@
Tag: mksh plan

<p class="boxhead"><tt>izabera</tt> did make a good point in IRC the other
 day for why we <em>will</em> need to have two locales at the very least in
 MirBSD – <tt>C</tt> and <tt>C.UTF-8</tt> (the latter being widespread
 enough by now, <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/609306">thanks to me</a>,
 interestingly enough. He uses code which leads to unexpected results…</p>
<div class="boxtext"><pre>
	$ generate() { tr -dc "[:alnum:]" &lt; /dev/urandom | dd bs="$len" count=1; }
	$ len=10; echo $(generate 2&gt;/dev/null)
	Ut流54Ȫf
</pre></div><p class="boxfoot">… because tr(1) was the first utility I
 converted to Unicode, to explore possibilities and craft the <a
 href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@permalinks/wlog-10_e20080802-tg.htm">OPTU encoding</a>
 and, thus, “流” is, indeed, an alphanumeric character.</p>
<p>This implies two things: we need to change MirBSD libc locale functions
 back to support two charsets (and make setlocale(3) match), and mksh(1)
 should implement locale tracking (to change <tt>set ±U</tt> whenever one
 of the relevant parameters (<tt>${LC_ALL:-${LC_CTYPE:-${LANG:-C}}}</tt>)
 changes in the session; users could still set <tt>utf8-mode</tt> manually
 though). For this to not break anything, we’ll have to audit scripts in
 MirBSD though (usually adding <tt>export LC_ALL=C</tt> at their begin is
 enough, and we need this for portable scripts anyway) and remove all
 occurrences of <tt>#ifndef __MirBSD__</tt> before setlocale(3) calls in
 applications. This will take a while.</p>
<hr />
<p>Secondly, I opened <a href="http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=1015">an
 issue with POSIX</a> about handling of the (deprecated, and for good reason)
 <tt>`</tt>-style command substitutions. The GNU autoconf texinfo manual gives
 good advice for portable shell scripts, and we all knew that <tt>foo="bar
 `echo \"baz\"`"</tt> wasn’t portable due to use of more than one set of double
 quotes, but my (and the yash authors’) reading of the standard (and <a
 href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm#r52">mksh R52</a>’s POSIX mode) make it set $foo to
 <tt>bar "baz"</tt> instead of the historic <tt>bar baz</tt> now, and I wish
 to get this clarified (and, possibly, the standard changed to match historic
 practice, as this breaks at least the Acrobat Reader 5 start script). Nothing
 has been decided yet (due to the holidays, I’m sure), but we got input from
 some other people involved in shell.</p>
<p>So, if any <tt>#!/bin/sh</tt> scripts break or behave weirdly with R52,
 you now know why. I’m waiting for an official statement.</p>

Title: New SSH hostkey for fish, taking over AnonCVS/AnonRSYNC service

Tag: archaeology hardware news plan security snapshot

<p>As announced in the earlier wlog entry about <a
 href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@permalinks/wlog-10_e20160208-tg.htm">server reorg</a>
 I’ve now switched over most services from the soon-to-be-defunct

 providing the redirection HTTP vhost for hostname-less <tt>mirbsd.org</tt>
 requests (i.e. people who don’t know how this works) and, soon, fallback
 HTTP services should they be needed. (He’s trusted with the SSL key and
 certificate.)</p>
<p>This also involves switching SSH hostkeys for AnonCVS, unfortunately;
 I’ve taken the chance to generate a fresh key for <tt>fish</tt>. Look in
 <a href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/"><tt>/MirOS/</tt></a> for the files (gzsig(1)

Title: Beltane Snapshot and Mainframe Korn Shell…ish
Tag: mksh pcli plan snapshot

<p>I was planning to do an mksh R56 release and then a full MirBSD
 snapshot (i386, sparc — due to actual user request — and possibly
 even a Live CD or at least baselive) but this got stones on my way.</p>
<p>I’m not quite finished with what I originally had planned for R56
 (basically, the Debian postfix package’s maintainer scripts started
 using character classes in bracket expressions, and this required
 not only careful planning and design but also quite some rewriting
 and thinking, fixing other bugs, reading the specs, <em>and</em>
 considering EBCDIC) which led to me asking the EBCDIC porter some
 things again, which led to trying to merge his outstanding patches
 and make R56 the Mainframe Korn Shell release (also mksh ;-) but
 we’re not quite there yet.</p>
<p>The MirBSD snapshot was planned to be started from CVS as of
 Beltane (Walpurgis) 2017 except the latest and greatest mksh is
 also kinda a requirement, and CVE fixes are tricking in, to add
 insult to injury for stuff I had just updated. I’d also love to
 have the latest sendmail and lynx in it but that’ll have to wait.</p>
<p>I’ll also do a new CVS snapshot tarball at the same time, so keep
 your eyes open for the new <a href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/current/">rolling
 MirBSD snapshot</a>.</p><!-- RSS stop -->
<p>Somehow, spring weather does not agree with me anyway. I didn’t
 get much done, nor much good sleep. Private life’s looking up but
 also more busy. I do manage to still help out others even in code
 I don’t really understand… must be good karma. Vacation would be
 nice… but then, I know I wouldn’t get all out of it.</p>

Title: Hurried snapshot and known issues
Tag: mksh pcli plan snapshot

<p>As <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@permalinks/wlog-10-tg_e20170626-tg.htm">already</a>
 <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@permalinks/news_e20170505-tg.htm">mentioned</a> I planned
 creating a new snapshot. Well, it will be out shortly, albeit in a hurried
 manner and not with everything I had planned for it, and with lagging sparc
 (as if <em>that</em> were new, though…). A hurried mksh release will there be
 as well. The reason for this is the top #1 known issue:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Debian OpenSSL now excludes TLS &lt; 1.2 from communication<br />
  ⇒ there will be some followup release with LibreSSL, I think</li>
 <li>There’s still no port for libGLU and xlock</li>
 <li>We didn’t import <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/lzip/lzlib.html">lzlib</a>
  into base yet, nor recent fixes to pax(1) from OpenBSD necessary</li>
 <li>The new Unicode property code is not written yet (although I fixed
  the data shipped so it matches, at least)</li>
 <li>I didn’t test g++ from ports on sparc yet, we’ll see how that goes</li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, you’ll be able to work with what I’ve got, like in
 olden times when MirBSD was defined as “the contents of <em>my</em>
 <tt>/usr/src</tt> and <tt>/usr/ports</tt>” and be assured that, besides
 working on things like MuseScore in the meantime, I’m on it.</p>
<p>An unrelated minor update to another recent post; apparently I managed
 to make the GitHub Legal people aware enough of the problems that they
 are working on fixing their ToS; I admit there’s been an update since
 August 1ˢᵗ/2ⁿᵈ which I haven’t yet gotten around to reading at all.</p>
<p><a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@wtf.htm">wtf</a> rocks; Eugen is working on an
 iOS äpp and already has a beta version which just needs bugfixing.</p>

Title: The Intelpocalypse
Tag: archaeology bug grml hardware pcli security

<p>The unveiling of the three new CPU bug classes, collected in the two
 brandbugs “Meltdown” and “Spectre”, has mostly shocked the BSDs; I’ve
 got it on some authority that even FreeBSD was not informed ahead of
 time, left alone the others. Thanks to laffer1 from MidnightBSD for a
 couple of heads-up warnings into our direction!</p>
<p>Here’s what I could gather until now (please <strong>do</strong>
 correct me if I’m wrong):</p>
<p><em>Meltdown</em> is specific to Intel® CPUs with out-of-order
 execution, that is, all P6-class (Pentium Pro/MMX, Pentium Ⅱ, but
 not Pentium Ⅰ/MMX) or newer (except old Atom) CPUs. It appears to
 allow user processes to read kernel memory, but not across VMs, nor
 to attack a hypervisor. A <em>variant for ARM</em> exists but AMD’s
 x86 CPUs are supposedly safe. The KAISER/FUCKWIT/UASS/KPTI patches
 for Linux fix this, at huge performance cost on x86, not so much on
 ARM, and no cost for unaffected CPU models (runtime detected).</p>
<p><em>Spectre</em> affects x86, ARM, POWER CPUs and possibly others.
 I’ve not yet found information on whether it is also limited to CPUs
 with out-of-order executions, but it seems likely. SPARC CPUs might
 be safe; Solaris/SPARC64 is safe due to the way its memory addressing
 works. If the OOO execution assumption is true, 80486 and P5 class
 x86 CPUs are also safe. This one <em>does</em> allow cross-VM and
 hypervisor attacks, so if the bare metal CPU is vulnerable, SOL.
 There does not yet seem to be a generic fix; some hint at having to
 patch the compiler and recompile everything with a workaround that
 has a performance cost, even if the CPU is not affected, or was fixed
 with a microcode update. AMD’s x86 CPUs are partially hit, one of the
 variants does not work on them.</p>
<p>“CERT recommends throwing away your CPU and buying an non-vulnerable
 one” (thanks to El Reg), but nobody states which CPUs are not vulnerable.
</p>
<p>At the present time, we suggest any MirBSD/i386 instances that run
 on any CPU other than an 80486 or P5-class (Pentium Ⅰ or a non-PPro MMX)
 to be restricted to single user or trusted user access only, and no
 untrusted software including ECMAscript to be run on them.</p>
<p>Watch <a href="http://www.mirbsd.org/#news">this space</a> for updates.
 Oh, and, if you know what you’re (and I’m) talking about, please, again,
 <strong>do</strong> provide me with information necessary to provide those
 updates, both to MirBSD and to this space. Thank you.</p>

 as this is a new system and VMware has issues, this will probably take
 a while. However, all data should be available from some place anytime.</p>

@• I was a bit frustrated by not finding a few Mystery caches but
  don’t know whether to log DNF (I do log DNF, but some are vague),
  and by lack of Geochecker for several puzzles I did, so I decided
  that a cache a day *still* keeps the Doctor away (unless the Doctor
  is called benz) and do some Virtual caches
• Also, unconfuse ABSPATH vs. RELPATH use: standardise on using
  RELPATH for anything we install and ABSPATH for anything we don’t;
  for cvs.cgi, it sure depends on something we don’t install (a local
  copy of the repo), but I guess that can be solved per-installation
• And – because I’m so nice *cough* need it – add jump-to-cache CGI
  (its HTML form only linked from my page, for now)

@ok, this is not(!) a showstopper: we cease to support Parallels Desktop
henceforth, until they fix their BIOS (no action needed on our part)

Benny, before attempting to kill me, please read the article, the specs
(both El Torito (I have the PDF) and the BIOS API docs), the pictures,
and try the demo ISO. Then divert such energy into filing a bug report
with them. Thank you in advance and afterwards.

20090126 snapshot looking better so far…
• qemu 0.7.2 from MirPorts Framework
• qemu svn (post 0.9.1) from Debian experimental
• Microsoft® VirtualPC
• (newly back) VMware Server 2
• (quite sure) actual hardware

Changes:

• All references (href, src, etc.) in *.inc files MUST now be absolute,
  with protocol specification (http https irc mailto), or prepended with
  either @@@@RELPATH@@@@ (as before) or @@@@ABSPATH@@@@ (new!). Note that @@@@ABSPATH@@@@
  must be followed by the initial slash, as it evaluates to nothing for the
  htm version.
• unset || true is no longer necessary in mksh R35b…
• mws_subdir has a new argument value ‘-’, which is the same as ‘0’ but
  copies the @@@@ABSPATH@@@@ value there instead
• use single-line sed -e -e -e argument style
• add domain and names to author tags
• simplify code some
• Benny I *told* you that I believe that when you escape < to &lt; you
  probably must also escape & to &amp; and probably > to &gt;
