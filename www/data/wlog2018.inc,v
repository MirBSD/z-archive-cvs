Title: Website consolidation

<p>I‚Äôm currently working on consolidating <tt>mirsolutions.de</tt>
 (as my former business is long defunct) and ‚ÄúThe MirOS Project‚Äù
 (that as of 2018 is also back to being my own one-man show / hobby)
 into <tt>www.mirbsd.org</tt> as my hobby / personal sorta homepage
 to not need any vhosts and simplify EU-DSGVO conformity. (I‚Äôve also
 reduced logging.) Please excuse upheavals, as well as the continued
 presence of old, obsoleted or outdated content that may even be, as
 of now, completely wrong; I‚Äôll fix it as time permits.</p>

Title: mksh bugfix‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthank you for the music
Tag: bug debian mksh pcli

<p>I‚Äôm currently working on an mksh(1) and bc(1) script that takes
 a pitch standard (e.g. ‚ÄúA‚ÇÑ = 440 Hz‚Äù or ‚ÄúC‚ÇÑ = 256 Hz‚Äù) and a config
 file describing a temperament (e.g. the usual equal temperament,
 or Pythagorean untempered pure fifths (with the wolf), or ‚Äújust‚Äù
 intonation, Werckmeister ‚Ö¢, Vallotti or Bach/Lehman 1722 (to name
 a few; these are all temperaments that handle enharmonics the same
 or, for Pythagorean in out case, ignore the fact they‚Äôre unplayable).
 Temperaments are rule-based, like in ttuner. Well, I‚Äôm not quite
 there yet, but I‚Äôm already able to display the value for MuseScore
 to adjust its pitch standard (it can only take A‚ÇÑ-based values), a
 frequency table, and a list and table of cent deltas (useful for using
 or comparing with other tuners). Of course, right now, the cent deltas
 are all 0 because, well, they are equal temperament against equal
 temperament (as baseline), but I can calculate <em>that</em> with
 arbitrary and very high precision!</p>
<p>For outputting, I wanted to make the tables align nicely; column(1),
 which I normally use, was out because it always left-aligns, so I used
 string padding in Korn Shell‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääexcept I‚Äôm also a Unicode BMP fan, so I
 had F‚ôØ and B‚ô≠ in my table headings, which were for some reason correctly
 right-aligned (for when the table values were integers) but not padded
 right when aligning with the decimal dot. So I worked around it, but
 also investigated.</p>
<p>Turns out that the desired length was used as second snprintf(3)
 argument, instead of, as in the right-align case, the buffer size.
 This worked only until multibyte characters happened. A fun bug,
 which only took about three minutes to find, and is covered by a
 new check in the testsuite even. Thought I‚Äôd share.</p>
<p>Feedback on and improvements for the tuner, once it‚Äôll be done,
 are, of course, also welcome. I plan to port the algorithm (once
 I‚Äôve got it down in a programming language I know <em>well</em>)
 to QML for inclusion in the tuner MuseScore plugin, even. Check <a
 href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/music/resources/tuner.sh">here, for now</a>, for
 my work in progress‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs quite big already despite doing basically
 nothing. Foundation laid (or so‚Ä¶).</p>

Title: Progress report from the Movim packaging sprint at MiniDebconf
Tag: debian

<p>Nik wishes you to know that the Movim packaging sprint (sponsored
 by the DPL, thank you!) is handled under the umbrella of the Debian
 Edu sprint (similarily sponsored) since this package is handled by
 the Teckids Debian Task Force, personnel from Teckids e.V.</p>
<p>After arriving, I‚Äôve started collecting knowledge first. I reviewed
 upstream‚Äôs <tt>composer.json</tt> file and Wiki page about dependencies
 and, after it quickly became apparent that we need <em>much</em> more
 information (e.g. which versions are in sid, what the package names are,
 and, most importantly, <strong>recursive</strong> dependencies), a <a
 href="https://wiki.teckids.org/wiki/MovimPaketierungsNotizen">Wiki page
 of our own</a> grew. Then I made a hunt for information about how to
 package stuff that uses PHP Composer upstream, and found the, ahem,
 wonderfully abundant, structured, plentiful and clear documentation from
 the Debian PHP/PEAR Packaging team. (Some time and reverse-engineering
 later I figured out that we just ignore <tt>composer</tt> and read its
 control file in <tt>pkg-php-tools</tt> converting dependency information
 to Debian package relationships. Much time later I also figured out it
 mangles package names in a specific way and had to rename one of the
 packages I created in the meantime‚Ä¶ thankfully before having uploaded
 it.) Quickly, the Wiki page grew listing the package names we‚Äôre supposed
 to use. I created a package which I could use as template for all others
 later.</p>
<p>The upstream Movim developer arrived as well‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe have quite an amount
 of upstream developers of various projects attending MiniDebConf, to the
 joy of the attendees actually directly involved in Debian, and this makes
 things much easier, as he immediately started removing dependencies (to
 make our job easier) and fixing bugs and helping us understand how some
 of those dependencies work. (I also contributed code upstream that replaces
 some Unicode codepoints or sequences thereof, such as 3‚É£ or ‚Äº or üë±üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,
 with &lt;img‚Ä¶/&gt; tags pointing to the SVG images shipped with Movim, with
 a description (generated from their Unicode names) in the alt attribute.)</p>
<p>Now, Saturday, all dependencies are packaged so far, although we‚Äôre still
 waiting for maintainer feedback for those two we‚Äôd need to NMU (or have them
 upload or us take the packages over); most are in NEW of course, but that‚Äôs
 no problem. Now we can tackle packaging Movim itself‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI guess we‚Äôll see
 whether those other packages actually work then ‚ò∫</p>
<p>We also had a chance to fix bugs in other packages, like guacamole-client
 and musescore.</p>
<p>In the meantime we‚Äôve also had the chance to socialise, discuss, meet, etc.
 other Debian Developers and associates and enjoy the wonderful food and superb
 coffee of the ‚ÄúCantina‚Äù at the venue; let me hereby express heartfelt thanks
 to the MiniDebConf organisation for this good location pick!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>, later this night: we took over the remaining two
 packages with permission from their previous team and uploader, and have
 already started with actually packaging Movim, discovering untold gruesome
 things in the <em>upstream</em> of the two webfonts it bundles.</p>

Title: learn.to/quote
Tag: archaeology debian news pcli tip

<p>The ‚Äúproperly quote eMail messages and on Usenet‚Äù documentation
 is hosted on a server that appears to not get too much care at the
 moment. I‚Äôve dug out workable versions:</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://www.afaik.de/usenet/faq/zitieren/download/zitieren-alles.html">current
 all-in-one-page German version (<span xml:lang="de-DE-1901">aktuelle
 alles-auf-einer-Seite-Fassung auf Deutsch</span>)</a>, with a short
 link on <tt>http://deb.li/quote</tt></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170227223930/http://www.briachons.org:80/art/quote/">last
 archived Dutch version (<span xml:lang="nl">laatste versie in het
 Nederlands</span>)</a>, the server is currently unreachable, but
 the Wayback Machine still has it</li>
<li><a href="https://www.netmeister.org/news/learn2quote.html">current
 English translation</a>, still workable</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://www.afaik.de/usenet/faq/zitieren/">original
 link</a>, with its <tt>http://learn.to/quote/</tt> redirection,
 which contained the links to the translations into Dutch and
 English, unfortunately no longer works.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm asking everyone to <em>please</em> honour these guidelines
 when posting in Usenet and responding to eMail messages, as not
 doing so is an insult to <em>all</em> the (<em>multiple</em>, in
 the case of Usenet and mailing lists) readers / recipients of your
 messages. Even if you have to spend a little time trimming the
 quote, it‚Äôs much less than the time spent by <em>all</em> readers
 trying to figure out a TOFU (reply over fullquote) message.</p>
<p xml:lang="de-DE-1901">Ich bitte jeden darum, sich <em>bitte</em>
 beim Posten im Usenet und Verfassen von eMails sich an diese
 Richtilinien zu halten; dies nicht zu tun ist ein Affront wider
 <em>alle</em> (im Falle von Usenet und Mailinglisten viele)
 Leser bzw. Empf√§nger eurer Nachrichten. Selbst wenn man zum
 K√ºrzen des Zitats ein bi√üchen Zeit aufwenden mu√ü ist das immer
 noch deutlich weniger als die M√ºhe, die <em>jeder einzelne</em>
 Leser aufwenden mu√ü, herauszufinden, was mit einer als TOFU
 (Text oben, Vollzitat unten) geschriebenen eMail gemeint ist.</p>
<p xml:lang="nl">Mag ik ieder√©√©n verzoeken, postings in het Usenet
 en mailtjes volgens deze regels te schrƒ≥ven? Als het niet te doen
 is vies tegen <em>alle</em> ontvanger‚Äôs en moeilƒ≥k om te lezen.
 Zelfs als je een beetje tƒ≥d nodig heb om het oorspronkelƒ≥ke deel
 te korten is het nog steeds minder dan de moeite van alleman, om
 een TOFU (antwoord boven, fullquote beneden) boodschap proberen
 te begrepen.</p>

Title: tons of updates, more coming‚Ä¶ (hope I didn‚Äôt break anything ‚ò∫)

<p>I‚Äôve updated a lot of things in MirBSD and for use with the
 Debian operating system. More to come, pax(1) has been converted
 to Mirtoconf (the successful <tt>Build.sh</tt> system of <a
 href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh</a>‚Äôs) but needs to be re-ported
 to a lot of systems (and some more bugs squished). My <a
 href="https://www.mirbsd.org/~tg/Debs/debidx.htm">‚ÄúWTF‚Äù APT
 repository</a> also received a number of updates, such as to the
 ever-desired wtf(1), but it‚Äôs the time of that two-year cycle
 which invites general care for all of one‚Äôs packages.</p>
<p>On the other hand, MirBSD stops offering RSS feeds by tags.
 The world has become more insular, first by DSGVO, now by other
 cultural issues. I‚Äôll be at FOSDEM, as usual, though, so rejoice!</p>
<p>You can now directly download, for all platforms and synthesisers, <a
 href="https://people.debian.org/~tg/sf/">the soundfonts shipped in
 Debian</a> for MuseScore (and others) I maintain. This service may
 cease at any time, without notice. Also, do mind the MIT licence.</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, happy new year in the western calendar!</p>

Title: FOSDEM
Tag: event fun

<p>I‚Äôve been going to FOSDEM for about half of my lifetime,
 give or take a year I think. So, of course, I will be there
 again this year. Thanks to my employer for sponsoring travel
 and accommodation again.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a bit annoying that the future of alternative OSes is
 a bit misty right now, depending on the hardware, but we‚Äôre
 continuing development, in subprojects (like mksh(1) and
 jupp(1), for example) and other projects (like Debian and
 MuseScore, whom I‚Äôll meet at FOSDEM again) while researching
 possible fixes for the security theatre.</p>

Title: Groeten vanuit Brussels, tƒ≥dens FOSDEM
Tag: event personal

<p>I‚Äôm in Bruxelles again, as every year since 2001, for <a
 href="https://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a>. (I only missed OSDEM
 in 2000, mostly due to the curse of late birth.)</p>
<p>To revive a tradition, I‚Äôve attempted (and successfully
 at that!) to find a place where we can eat Couscous Merguez,
 and we met up with bsiegert@@ and had some nice conversation
 and, besides the overly LOUD!!! belly dance, delicious food.
 It was nice to catch up with each other again.</p>
<p>Other than that, see you over the next few days at ULB!
 Don‚Äôt miss the MuseScore booth and the two Teckids talks.</p>
