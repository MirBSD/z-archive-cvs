Title: New “Mirzeitkarte” theme for Mapsforge / c:geo
Date: 2019-04-10 23:20
Tag: geocache

<p>The <a href="https://www.freizeitkarte-osm.de/">Freizeitkarte</a>
 offline OpenStreetMap vector maps can be rendered with MapsForge,
 a library which is embedded in several Android applications like <a
 href="https://www.cgeo.org/">c:geo</a>. (Note that c:geo ships two
 instances of it, the “old MapsForge v3 API” which works much better
 on my ancient HTC Desire and the standard newer one.) However, this
 uses the stock rendering theme of MapsForge by default, which is an
 old Osmarender one (in v3 at least, later MapsForge extends it) and
 kinda sucks for detailled navigation, such as what GPS Stash Hunters
 need to do.</p>
<p>Thankfully Freizeitkarte ships a MapsForge theme, well two, one
 with more contrast or something. Did I say “ships”? Oops, “shipped”
 is more correct. It was taken offline (with, unfortunately, no trace
 any more online) some years ago due to difficulties or something.</p>
<p>Luckily, I still have a copy (in which I enabled several “extra”
 features (such as displaying bus stops, which ought to be default…)
 which I can use. But this has several problems: it needs fixing, as
 upstream said, and OSM also developed, so I could not see any ramps
 (lanes to join/exit highways) any more.</p>
<p>Well, jupp and XML editing and OSM data inspection to the rescue.
 I now maintain the XML in a private git repo (although I unfortunately
 only have the preconfigured one as starting point), and I extended,
 changed and fixed it a lot and redrew two of the images, and <a
 href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/privat/freizeitkarte.zip">freizeitkarte.zip</a>
 is the fruit of these efforts. It likely can still use more fixing
 and extending but is at least usable, and the licence is rather
 liberal. Perhaps I should rename it to Mirzeitkarte to clarify it
 is not the original any more, but for now I did it in the title of
 this wlog entry. (Dear Freizeitkarte people, please do contact me
 if you have anything to say. We could even populate your fzk-theme
 github repository.)</p>
<p><strong>Update 2019-04-22:</strong> I’ve renamed the XML (but not
 the PKZIP archive name, as to not break deep links) and have fixed
 more stuff, continuing to do so. Freizeitkarte people just pointed
 me to Geoclub (an independent webforum) for “support”, so they seem
 to not be interested. I do have permission though.</p>
<p>In unrelated news, the <a href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/music/free/">Free
 Music repository</a> also grew, and the soundfont has an update.</p>

Title: ISP change
Date: 2019-04-22 20:21
Tag: hardware personal

<p>I’m going to be switched from ADSL (version 1) at Netcologne
 to VDSL with Vectoring at Telekom Business tomorrow. So, if I
 seem to have fallen off the earth, you’ll know why.</p>
<p>I should also take this as chance to replace the ne(4) NIC
 my current DSL modem is connected to (a 10 Mbit/s card, but at
 least already PCI) with another fxp(4) to make use of the more
 speed (50/10 Mbit/s instead of 4/½ or so).</p>
<p>I’ve set up Backup MX (already had Backup NS), so nothing
 should suffer too much except response times, perhaps.</p>

Title: ISP move
Date: 2019-06-04 23:58
Tag: hardware personal

<p>In a similar vain as last post, I’ll be moving with my ISP
 (to a new 1ˢᵗ TAE) next Tyrsday. I hope everything will be as
 unupsetting as last time…</p>

Title: FixedMisc [MirOS] 20190604 released!
Date: 2019-06-04 23:59
Tag: news pcli

<p>Today I’ve released another new CVS snapshot of the <a
 href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/dist/mir/Foundry/"><tt>FixedMisc [MirOS]</tt>
 font</a>; as usual, the tarball contains the font in BDF form, with
 no conflict with the system <tt>Fixed [Misc]</tt> font; <a
 href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@cvs.cgi/contrib/fonts/fixed/">sources</a>
 for use (compilation, editing) with bdfctool(1) are in CVS.</p>
<p>New: the UCS map for the 8x16 cp437 font is also shipped within
 the tarball, in the hope of helping someone with it. (The 8x16 font
 isn’t just badly truncated 9x18, but specially adapted for that size.)</p>
<p>This release was partially sponsored by tarent, and it is dedicated
 to my actual users, who submit bug reports and feature requests.</p>
<p>To Japanese users, the <tt>U+32FF SQUARE ERA NAME REIWA</tt> from
 Unicode 12.1 prerelease is included. The missing small caps Q was
 added just as the ring form of the Benzol ring. The minuscle lambda
 and pi were tweaked (especially lambda looked like crap), the coptic
 pi was, to avoid mistaking it for greek, changed minimally, too).</p>
<p>In a next release, I’m planning to make the digit seven (‘7’) more
 a seven, less a one (7̶ or 7̵ or better), and switch to “single-storey”
 ‘a’ and ‘g’ (mind ɑ and ɡ though).</p>
<p>My <a href="https://www.mirbsd.org/~tg/Debs/debidx.htm">“WTF” APT
 repository</a> contains the (updated) <tt>xfonts-base</tt> package,
 which ships FixedMisc [MirOS], and (new!) <tt>consolefonts-base</tt>
 with the 8x16 PSF (SYSLINUX, ISOLINUX, PXELINUX) and PSFU (Linux VGA
 text console), 9x18 and 18x18 GRUB fonts, and, as usual, the patched
 <tt>console-setup</tt> with the 9x18 for Linux’ framebuffer console.</p>

Title: Harry Potter in Unicode
Date: 2019-08-03 21:16
Tag: fun

<p style="font-size:xx-large;">☺͛</p>
<p>I wasn’t even looking for it but for <tt>LATIN SMALL LETTER S WITH
 CROWN ABOVE</tt> or <tt>COMBINING CROWN ABOVE</tt> for… Wasⷳa? Wasⷿa?
 Was̐a?… that, anyway, but didn’t find it, when I found <em>that</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Of <em>course</em>, Mozilla® Firefox™
 renders it wrong. In lynx (standard browser) in xterm (standard terminal)
 it properly renders like <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@pics/wlog/HPinUCS.png"><img
 src="pics/wlog/HPinUCSt.png" alt="SMILEY with COMBINING ZIGZAG" /></a></p>
<p>I wonder when the first UIs will render it as inline small HP photo…</p>

Title: Updating IBM X40 with CompactFlash card
Date: 2019-08-18
Tag: hardware personal

<p>So, I’ll be updating my IBM Thinkpad X40 from an almost broken 40 GB
 1.6″ IDE HDD (with 2.5″ connector) to a dual (IDE master/slave) CF card
 adapter with… two (but I cannot find one of them right now) cards with
 a whopping 64 GiB, each ☺</p>
<p>I’ll take the added space to install it as a dual boot system so I can
 play some games… Diablo, Hellfire, StarCraft, BroodWar, Diablo Ⅱ, LoD…
 again (and perhaps create more binaries of MirSoftware for those sad OS
 users). It’ll be frustrating.</p>
<p>I’m also taking the chance to reinstall MirBSD on the laptop “fresh”
 and build binary packages for MirPorts and publish it as a half-snapshot
 (sparc needs more tuits) which is likely going to take time, during
 which I’ll be on other laptops, limited in agility.</p>

Title: MirCPIO (paxmirabilis) 20190825 released
Date: 2019-08-25
Tag: bug geocache rant archaeology

<p>There’s a new <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@pax.htm">MirCPIO (paxmirabilis;
 tar, ar)</a> release. Difference is, some operating systems don’t
 yet support passing <i>nil</i> as second argument to realpath(3)
 which incidentally included (note: past tense) a certain BSD whose
 installer segfaulted in tar(1)…</p>
<p>Debian GNU/Hurd was, btw, not affected.</p>
<p>In other news, it’s way too hot and other IRL things take up tuits.</p>
<p>And in completely (I’m sure) unrelated news, my waypoint statistics
 are not getting updated for now, and <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@wtf.htm">acronym</a>
 submissions pile up in the queue. (The broken iOS Äpp link has been forwarded
 to the author. Techniker ist informiert. YMMV)</p>

Title: So… edugit? gitlab? ruby? maintainer scripts? RoDD/QA?
Date: 2019-08-28
Tag: bug debian personal rant work

<p>So… the Debian package of gitlab is too buggy to be used (was built
 against ruby-asciidoc version X.Y while sid carries X.(Y+1) now, which
 causes it to bug around, of course, as proper for an immature language
 like that. So, someone decided to switch to the GitLab CE *.deb format
 packages (not Debian packages — not Free; just Open Core but Debian
 itself uses those for its “Salsa” instance as well (<a
 href="https://mako.cc/writing/hill-free_tools.html">which</a> is,
 incidentally, why I refuse use of that whenever possible) and, for that,
 removed the Debian packages. The gitlab binary package helpfully offered
 to not delete the repositories, but gitlab-common’s postrm not only
 removed the user account (a <em>big</em> no-no!) but used the option to
 delete its home directory… which is where the git repositories and project
 icons and the likes are stored under. (Note that undeleting from ext3/4
 is hard, unlike ext2, and if fsck and/or a journal replay is run, chances
 get worse… the ext4undelete tool “helpfully” requires an fsck run… ’nuff
 said… if you ever accidentally delete something, immediately unplug power
 and destroy VMs hard, then <em>snapshot the filesystem</em> so multiple
 rescue approaches aren’t made impossible.)</p>
<p class="boxhead">Anyway, it’s apparently running GitLab CE now, which
 means that all the remotes have changed. I used this…</p>
<div class="boxtext">
 <pre>
	sudo find / -xdev -name config | grep '/\.git/config$' &gt;~/xgc
	sudo fgrep -li gitlab@@edugit.org $(&lt;~/xgc) &gt;~/xgc2
	&lt;~/xgc2 sudo xargs perl -pi -e 's/gitlab\@@edugit.org/git\@@edugit.org/gi'
 </pre>
</div><p class="boxfoot">… for fixing up mine (inspect the temporary files
 and check find(1) and mount(8) for <tt>-xdev</tt> to get the right files
 found).</p>
<p>Also, <tt>~/.gitconfig</tt> <tt>insteadOf</tt> / <tt>pushInsteadOf</tt>
 need fixing. Let me plug an undercover avertisement for my <a
 href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@cvs.cgi/contrib/hosted/tg/.gitconfig?rev=HEAD">.gitconfig</a>
 here, which contains examples for <tt>insteadOf</tt> as well as commands to
 download GitLab merge and GitHub pull requests.</p>
<p class="boxhead">After having fixed those up, go to the web UI and click
 on “Create empty repository”, then push all remote branches recorded in
 your hopefully up-to-date clone and (all) tags to the instance:</p>
<div class="boxtext">
 <pre>
	remote=<span class="u">origin</span>
	git branch -r | sed -n "/^  $remote\\//s///p" | \
	    while read branchname rest; do
		test x"$branchname" = x"HEAD" &amp;&amp; continue
		echo "pushing $remote/$branchname"
		git push "$remote" "$remote/$branchname:refs/heads/$branchname"
	done
	git push "$remote" --tags
 </pre>
</div><p class="boxfoot">Adjust the <tt>remote</tt> variable if necessary.
 Run this in all clones you have access to; not using force pushes makes
 only those pushes which actually add commits succeed. All repositories
 hosted on the edugit instance are affected and need(ed) restoring, which,
 thankfully, appears to make everything else, like stored merge requests,
 work again (although the project and group logos are gone, which need
 re-uploading). That being said, unapplied merge requests are stored in
 special refs which are not normally cloned… so they’re gone now.</p>

Title: The fate of MirOS Linux, and a birthday post
Date: 2019-09-01
Tag: archaeology fun plan

<p>MirBSD has just <a href="https://twitter.com/Knoblauchkeks/status/1167119275800350720">recently
 become 17 years old</a>, and I wrote (in German, sorry ☺) a <a
 href="https://chat.teckids.org/?blog/tglaser%40mercurius.teckids.org/mirbsd-ist-heute-17-jahre-alt-geworden-62Hv9C">reminiscing
 piece about that and thanking everyone involved</a>.</p>
<p>Today my calendar(1) reminded me of the first steps towards
 “MirLinux”, a.k.a. “MirOS Linux”, 16 years ago and given this
 pops up regularily, especially due to Wikipedia spreading it,
 I feel I have to clarify: cnuke (the original Jupp) really likes
 the BSD userspace but wants to play Quake Ⅲ with accelerated 3D,
 so the idea was to maybe build everything for Linux, add a glibc
 and other dependent libraries (and we’d use different paths, so
 linking is unaffected and we’d have nicer linking semantics than
 those GNU people), and maybe things would just work.</p>
<p>It was a woozy idea right from the start, and there might have
 been beer involved, and nobody ever got around to actually doing
 so, and it clearly was never a/the project goal. Yes, we probably
 could have done it, back then, up to 90% satisfaction, and with
 some more binaries thrown in from GNU/Linux (e.g. for the packet
 filter, as — sadly… ― pf(4) for Linux has never materialised) it
 could have become usable, and there was ecce!GNU/Linux precedent,
 but BSD’s the focus. Perhaps if a certain few people had been
 less <i xml:lang="de">Verpeiler</i>… oh well — no big loss.</p>
<p>I <em>did</em> turn out fixing stuff in GNU/Linux and porting
 stuff over in the end, but we never merged them, which perhaps
 turned out, looking back, to be a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>Tomorrow</strong> 16 years ago, plip(4) support was
 added… I need to dig out the cable and run some interoperability
 tests some time to see if it’s still working, with both Crynwr
 and Linux on the remote end, and FreeBSD (if they still have it).</p>
<!-- RSS stop --><p>In unrelated news, other activity has been
 suspended, as I caught a “summer flu”, which turned out (and very
 quickly, at that) a rather harsh <i>sinusitis-<span
 xml:lang="la">cum</span>-bronchitis</i>, taking me out and sapping
 all concentration, expected to linger for a few more days.</p>
