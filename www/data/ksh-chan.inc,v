Title: Development host for ksh2020 (ksh93 successor by Red Hat)
Link: https://github.com/att/ast

Repository in which a Red Hat employee and others continue
development of AT&amp;T ksh93, as reportedly, AT&amp;T has
no further interest in Korn Shell. This version is <a
 href="http://situ.im/posts/kornshell-2020-impossible-happens">now</a>
called ksh2020.
----
Title: Homepage of the original Korn Shell (now dead)
Link: http://www.kornshell.com/

This is the homepage for the original (AT&amp;T) Korn Shell,
where sources and binaries for ksh93 as well as information
are available. It is a modern shell with many features for
both interactive and script use, extensible, and can be used
as shared library. It’s also locale aware and thus UTF-8
ready on most modern operating systems.
<a href="http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/download/">Download</a>
----
Title: Homepage of the MirBSD Korn Shell
Link: @@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm

This is the homepage of the MirBSD Korn Shell (mksh), which
is <strong>the</strong> actively developed successor of pdksh.
The focus is a compact yet featureful shell, so several of the
ksh93/bash/zsh extensions are present, while others, such as
floating point arithmetic, will not be provided, even though
the aim is as generic as ksh93’s (interactive and script use;
embedding is not yet possible) and to be very portable, also
to include some extensions of its own. It’s UTF-8 aware.
----
Title: Frequently Asked Questions for The MirBSD Korn Shell
Link: http://www.mirbsd.org/mksh-faq.htm

Questions you never knew you’d ask.
----
Title: (archived version of the) ksh FAQ
Link: http://web.archive.org/web/20130527195150/http://www2.research.att.com/~gsf/download/ksh/faq.html

FAQ for the Korn Shell, including which variants exist.
----
Title: mksh external (optional) bugtracker
Link: https://bugs.launchpad.net/mksh

The MirOS Project normally uses eMail and IRC for bug handling.
However, some people prefer a web application. Launchpad offered,
so this is the mksh external bugtracker which such people can use.
Its bugmail will also be sent to the mksh mailing list.
----
Title: mksh snapshot downloads
Link: https://www.mirbsd.org/MirOS/dist/mir/mksh/snapshot/

Snapshots of the MirBSD Korn Shell can often be found here.
Versions with an “i” before the date (yyyymmdd) are of the
MAIN development branch, all others are of the stable bugfix
branch.
----
Title: mksh/Win32 Beta 14 announcement
Link: @@@@RELPATH@@@@permalinks/wlog-10_e20130718-tg.htm

----
Title: Homepage of the Public Domain Korn Shell
Link: http://www.cs.mun.ca/~michael/pdksh/

This is the homepage of the Public Domain Korn Shell (pdksh),
where last development happened in 1999, when the original
Korn Shell used to be commercial/proprietary software.
----
Title: CVSweb for OpenBSD’s ksh
Link: http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/bin/ksh/

This is OpenBSD’s version of pdksh, which has been enhanced
and bugfixed relative to it and eventually spawned mksh.
It has been ported to other operating systems several times:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090701170731/http://www.delilinux.de/oksh/">oksh in DeliLinux</a>,
<a href="http://people.freebsd.org/~tmclaugh/">OpenKSH by
 FreeBSD’s Tom McLaughlin</a>, etc.

Unix sh manual page from SCO times.
----
Title: ksh88 manual page
Link: http://uw714doc.sco.com/en/man/html.1/ksh88.1.html

ksh88 was the AT&amp;T Korn Shell before ksh93 happened.
It lacks many features from later pdksh versions and
especially pdksh/mksh. It’s mainly suited for scripting
these days, and comes with many commercial/proprietary
operating systems.
----
Title: MKS Toolkit
Link: http://www.mkssoftware.com/products/tk/ds_tkdev.asp

The MKS ksh is the one David Korn lost some disapproving
words about. Nevertheless, it implements some part of the
Korn Shell language and is available for certain systems.

a: which-shell

mirabilos’ <a href="http://www.mirbsd.org/cvs.cgi/~checkout~/contrib/code/Snippets/getshver?rev=HEAD;content-type=text%2Fplain">getshver</a>
is a script that tells you which shell it runs under. It
currently supports most Bourne Shell, POSIX Shell, Korn
Shell, Z Shell, C Shell variants as well as the TCL Shell.
----
Title: Which shell and version do I run? Ⅱ
Link: http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/whatshell/whatshell.sh.html

Sven Mascheck also has a shell detector, with emphasis on
shells without any version variable; mostly supports old
Bourne-compatible shells including POSIX and Korn Shell
and some Z Shell but no C Shell or TCL.
----
Title: Which shell and version do I run? Ⅲ
Link: http://stchaz.free.fr/which_interpreter

This one is a tad hilarious, as it’s got support for things like
DOS <tt>CMD.EXE</tt> and possibly <tt>COMMAND.COM</tt>, Tcl, Perl,
Python and whatnot. It’s a tad terse on the Korn Shell side, though.
----
Title: shbot, as seen in #bash and #ksh

<p class="boxhead"><tt>shbot</tt> is a bot that takes from an IRC

ISBN: 978-1-56592-054-5 (1-56592-054-6)

O'Reilly, 360 pages, 1993.
It’s a good introduction and reference to ksh88; most of it

surpassed a few times.

replacing both ksh88 and their Bourne (nōn-POSIX) <tt>/bin/sh</tt>.
(Although <tt>mirabilos</tt> thinks that the old ksh88 should not
be available as <tt>/usr/bin/oksh</tt> but rather ksh88, due to

command line. Lots of command shells are available, from Bash and
Korn to C shell and various exotic and strange shells. Learn which

Title: Solaris ksh93-integration project
Link: http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/ksh93-integration/

Homepage of the project attempting to integrate ksh93 in Solaris,
replacing both ksh88 and their Bourne (nōn-POSIX) <tt>/bin/sh</tt>.
(Although <tt>mirabilos</tt> thinks that the old ksh88 should not
be available as <tt>/usr/bin/oksh</tt> but rather ksh88, due to
oksh’s existence as pdksh derivate.)

Title: * Portable Shell::

Part of the GNU Autoconf manual dealing with how to make shell
scripts portable (if desirable to not target one specific shell,
such as ksh93 or mksh, and making that one portable). Interesting
for archæologists as well.

Title: Package page for pdksh in Debian
Link: http://packages.debian.org/sid/pdksh

This is Debian’s packaging of pdksh, which includes several
fixes from oksh and some of their own. These that were not
bogus found their way into mksh. It spawned posh (the POsix
SHell), which attempts to use pdksh code with Korn Shell
features removed to provide a viable <tt>/bin/sh</tt> for
Debian (and has since begun to take patches from mksh).
