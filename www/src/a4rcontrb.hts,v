<p>This will, some day, be the homepage of the arc4random(3) suite
 for non-MirBSD systems. The codes need to be rewritten anyway, and
 maybe unified with these for MirBSD. We currently have (these are
 CVSweb links and, as such, provide you with changelogs):</p><ul>
<li><a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@cvs.cgi/contrib/code/Snippets/arc4random.c">mircvs://contrib/code/Snippets/arc4random.c</a>
 (main supplementary file for non-MirBSD systems; suggested for use with <a
 href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh</a>)</li>
<li><a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@cvs.cgi/src/lib/libc/crypt/arc4random.c">mircvs://src/lib/libc/crypt/arc4random.c</a>
 (code in MirBSD base, MirBSD specific)</li>
<li><a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@cvs.cgi/contrib/hosted/tg/arc4rootdom.c">mircvs://contrib/hosted/tg/arc4rootdom.c</a>
 (supplemental file providing arc4random_pushb(3) for Android and in
 FreeWRT assuming the executing user is root and can write to urandom(4)</li>
<li><a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@cvs.cgi/contrib/hosted/tg/deb/klibc/arc4random.c">mircvs://contrib/hosted/tg/deb/klibc/arc4random.c</a>
 (draft patch providing arc4random(3) API on top of linprocfs for klibc,
 using jrand48(3) instead of aRC4 as algorithm, for size reasons</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also <a href="@@@@ABSPATH@@@@/MirOS/dist/hosted/other/">versioned
 downloads</a> of the main <tt>arc4random.c</tt> file, for mksh(1) packagers'
 convenience. (Nowadays, <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@mksh.htm">mksh</a> doesn’t use
 it any longer, but others – BSD::arc4random, for example – do.)</p>

<h2>See also</h2>
<p><a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/libbsd-dev">Debian package
 page</a> for <a href="http://libbsd.freedesktop.org/">libbsd</a>, which
 also provided arc4random(3) and friends</p>

@• I was a bit frustrated by not finding a few Mystery caches but
  don’t know whether to log DNF (I do log DNF, but some are vague),
  and by lack of Geochecker for several puzzles I did, so I decided
  that a cache a day *still* keeps the Doctor away (unless the Doctor
  is called benz) and do some Virtual caches
• Also, unconfuse ABSPATH vs. RELPATH use: standardise on using
  RELPATH for anything we install and ABSPATH for anything we don’t;
  for cvs.cgi, it sure depends on something we don’t install (a local
  copy of the repo), but I guess that can be solved per-installation
• And – because I’m so nice *cough* need it – add jump-to-cache CGI
  (its HTML form only linked from my page, for now)

@add three (empty, for now) more subproject pages, tbf with content
• BSD::arc4random with changelog, links, docs and things
• arc4random.c with changelog; including the klibc implementation
  with different backend (jrand48) but same to-user API
• The RANDEX protocol, available clients and plugins, with changelogs
  for them, to serve as homepages too
