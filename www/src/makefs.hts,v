<p>Homepage of the NetBSD® makefs(8) utility, MirBSD bugfixed variant.</p>

<h2 id="main">NetBSD® makefs(8) – MirBSD bugfixes</h2>
<p>This page is not ready yet; it will be with/for the next release, which
 will contain Fedora portability glue in addition to the Debian one (already
 in CVS) and fix some of the uses of “long” instead of “off_t” etc.</p>
<p>The <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@TaC-makefs.txt">licence terms</a> will also be
 filled in by then.</p>

<p>Current packaging: <a href="http://packages.debian.org/makefs">Debian</a>.
 In MirOS BSD, it’s in-tree, even on our ISO images and installer kernels,
 MirOS BSD4me (<a href="http://netboot.me/">netboot.me</a>) and bsd4grml,
 together with a cdio(1) that can burn CDs in track-at-once mode. Both are
 100% free of code of J�rg.</p>

<h2 id="notices">Legal notices</h2>
<p class="note">This product includes software developed for the NetBSD
 Project by Wasabi Systems, Inc.</p>

@• I was a bit frustrated by not finding a few Mystery caches but
  don’t know whether to log DNF (I do log DNF, but some are vague),
  and by lack of Geochecker for several puzzles I did, so I decided
  that a cache a day *still* keeps the Doctor away (unless the Doctor
  is called benz) and do some Virtual caches
• Also, unconfuse ABSPATH vs. RELPATH use: standardise on using
  RELPATH for anything we install and ABSPATH for anything we don’t;
  for cvs.cgi, it sure depends on something we don’t install (a local
  copy of the repo), but I guess that can be solved per-installation
• And – because I’m so nice *cough* need it – add jump-to-cache CGI
  (its HTML form only linked from my page, for now)
