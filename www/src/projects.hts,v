<p>The following project ideas can be submitted to the MirOS Project
 by everybody who feels like having the necessary skills.
 To avoid duplicate work, we suggest the applicant to <a
 href="rss.htm#lists">contact us at the miros-discuss public
 mailing list</a> first.</p>

<p>Submissions ought to be made under the <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@MirOS-Licence">MirOS
 Licence</a>, but any other licence which is equivalent to the UCB/BSD
 licence is OK. We suggest to not add advertising clauses, though.</p>

<h2>List of ideas</h2>

<p><b>Fix annoying bugs in nroff,&nbsp;</b> especially these which prevent it
 from outputting correctly formatted manual pages when not built with -O1 or
 -fno-omit-frame-pointer on gcc 3.4-stable snapshots (even on Debian).
 If the code is also cleaned up a bit, chances are it will make into
 stock OpenBSD at least for plain nroff support. Also, ask Brian Kerninghan
 for a licence for ditroff, start hacking on it instead (tg@@ has got the
 sources, they just lack a licence and copyright marker).</p>

<p class="boxhead">The first bug you should look at is even exposed when using -O1:</p>
<div class="boxtext">
 On a side note: does anyone who is experienced in C
 and gdb (I'm not familiar with the latter...) want to
 fix the bugs in src/usr.bin/oldroff/nroff/ which make
 it show
<pre>The options that operate on the names of files or archive members
(-c,-i, -n, -s, -u, -v, -D, -G, -T, -U, -Y, and -Z) interact as follows.</pre>
in the pax(1) manual page, instead of (hand-edited)
<pre>The options that operate on the names of files or archive members (-c,
-i, -n, -s, -u, -v, -D, -G, -T, -U, -Y, and -Z) interact as follows.</pre>
or, depending on the line length,
<pre>The options that operate on the names of files or archive members
(-c, -i, -n, -s, -u, -v, -D, -G, -T, -U, -Y, and -Z) interact as follows.</pre>
 This is .Po and .Pc, all others (.Qo/.Qc and so on) are
 broken the same way, and it gets worse if you build nroff
 with -O2/-Os instead of -O1 (-funit-at-a-time also exhibits
 the bug, but this time I'm convinced it's a bug in nroff).
</div>
<p class="boxfoot">(from an eMail)</p>

<p>Estimated effort: Time - medium; Skill - low</p>

<p><b>Port MirOS BSD to the Xen machine virtualisation technique.&nbsp;</b>
 This can probably be done by looking at the NetBSD code and giving credit
 where due. Domain U and Xen 2.0 support is a must; Domain 0 support
 would be an additional bonus.</p>

<p>We would like to not need src/sys/arch/xen, rather keep it integrated
 in src/sys/arch/i386, except for the Xen-specific device drivers,
 which can go to src/sys/arch/i386/xen/ (DomU drivers).</p>

<p>Estimated effort: Time - high; Skill - medium</p>

<p><b>Port FFS snapshots support to MirOS BSD.&nbsp;</b> In addition to that,
 port at least one of UBC (unified buffer cache) or UFS2 support. Again, this
 can be made quite easily by looking at how NetBSD has done it; in
 addition, Ted Unangst of OpenBSD has published some experimental diffs
 to the OpenBSD mailing lists.</p>

<p>Estimated effort: Time - medium; Skill - medium (high if UBC)</p>

<p><b>Add support for IPv4 mapped IPv6 addresses to MirOS BSD,&nbsp;</b>
 controllable with a sysctl (net.inet6.ip6.v6only), so that, if the sysctl is
 set to 0, a daemon listening on (say) [::]:53 will receive IPv4-transport
 (on the wire) packets as IPv6-mapped (in the protocol stack) connections
 and is able to process them without having to listen to [0.0.0.0]:53 as
 well. Keep care that these IPv4-mapped IPv6 packets are never seen on
 the wire, and that IPv4-mapped packets seen on the wire are always
 discarded, for security reasons.</p>

<p>Estimated effort: Time - medium; Skill - medium</p>

<p><b>Communicate with upstream and send back diffs.&nbsp;</b> This is urgent
 for XFree86&reg;, high priority for GNU binutils; low priority for all
 other stuff (probably not interesting for gcc at all). The project
 assignee will have to make himself familiar with the MirOS-local
 diffs first &ndash; not always an easy task because we inherited a
 lot of them from OpenBSD. (Optionally, add support for cross-building
 to OpenBSD targets first.)</p>

<p>Estimated effort: Time - medium to high; Skill - low but specialised</p>

<p><b>Merge improvements from NetBSD&reg;&nbsp;</b> &ndash; especially in the
 following fields: make(1); binutils and gcc (so we can cross-build
 to all or almost all NetBSD&reg; targets); ...</p>

<p>Estimated effort: Time - medium to high; Skill - medium</p>

<p><b>Remove Perl dependency from the MirPorts Framework</b> – allows
 e.g. MidnightBSD users to use MirPorts without having to install Perl
 from mports first. Simplifies maintenance, as developers don’t have
 to learn Perl. (Possibly add a lang/perl5 port though, to depend on
 it.) Replace “perl -pi -e "s/foo/bar/g" …” invocations in Makefiles
 by “print ',g/foo/s//bar/g\nwq' | ed -s …”.</p>

<p>Estimated effort: Time – low; Skill – low + Perl knowledge</p>

<h2>Implementation notes</h2>

<p>Unless we are accepted as a mentoring organisation at Google's
 &quot;Summer of Code&quot; we are sorry we cannot offer a bounty
 for completion of these tasks. We are trying, though.</p>

<p>People working on the above projects will be listed there so you
 can contact them if required.</p>

@• I was a bit frustrated by not finding a few Mystery caches but
  don’t know whether to log DNF (I do log DNF, but some are vague),
  and by lack of Geochecker for several puzzles I did, so I decided
  that a cache a day *still* keeps the Doctor away (unless the Doctor
  is called benz) and do some Virtual caches
• Also, unconfuse ABSPATH vs. RELPATH use: standardise on using
  RELPATH for anything we install and ABSPATH for anything we don’t;
  for cvs.cgi, it sure depends on something we don’t install (a local
  copy of the repo), but I guess that can be solved per-installation
• And – because I’m so nice *cough* need it – add jump-to-cache CGI
  (its HTML form only linked from my page, for now)
