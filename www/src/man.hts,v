<h2>Browse all manpages</h2>
<p>Online manual pages for the <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@htman/i386/">i386</a>
 and <a href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@htman/sparc/">sparc</a> architectures, including
 other HTML format documentation and formatted texinfo pages, are also
 available for direct perusal. The below search form will only search
 through the stock Unix®, Perl and XFree86® manpages. See also our <a
 href="@@@@RELPATH@@@@wtf.htm">acronym database and web search</a>.</p>

<h2>Look for a manpage by name</h2>
<form accept-charset="utf-8" action="@@@@RELPATH@@@@man.cgi" method="get"><p>
 <input type="text" name="q" size="42" maxlength="255" />
 <input type="submit" />
</p></form>
<p>All architectures will be searched by default. The first full match
 of a regular manpage, if any, is displayed directly. This is not an
 apropos(1) search, only manpage name matches are checked (matches for
 queries with less than three characters are anchored at the beginning).</p>

@prevent DoS in man.cgi (idea by Carsten Klein):
when a query is less then 3 chars, anchor it at the beginning

(waaaaaaay better than others who just forbid such searches)
