<p>This is currently just a placeholder page. I have recently forked <a
 href="http://member.wide.ad.jp/wg/mgp/">MagicPoint</a> because I needed
 to make deep changes as part of bugfixing and want to revitalise it.</p>
<p><img width="389" height="159" alt="[old MagicPoint logo, slightly moving]"
 src="@@@@RELPATH@@@@pics/logos/mgp-old2.jpg" /></p>
<p>I’ll release MagicPoint 2.0 which will support (and, incompatiblily,
 require) presentation files to be UTF-8 encoded and generate texts etc.
 thusly (PostScript® will need help). I may release MagicPoint 1.2 to
 step in until ready, hardcoding the current state of affairs in Debian
 (Xft2 as the only font library etc.) but with trimmed-down and fixed
 code plus Mirtoconf (build system familiar from mksh and paxmirabilis).</p>
<p>Development is done on Debian and MirBSD. Some of it is sponsored by <a
 href="http://www.tarent.de/">⮡ tarent</a>, some is contributed privately.
 Please also see my MagicPoint workshops:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="https://mirabilos.edugit.org/mscore-workshop/">MuseScore</a></li>
 <li>(more being developed)</li>
</ul>
<p>Development is done in public, in a git repository: <a
 href="https://evolvis.org/plugins/scmgit/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=alioth/magicpoint.git;a=summary"
 >MagicPoint repository on Evolvis</a><br />
 Discussion and patch submission on <a href="irc.htm">IRC</a>
 (<tt>#MirBSD</tt>) and on the <tt>miros-discuss</tt> <a
 href="rss.htm#lists">mailing list</a> as usual, no “pull requests”
 or other Web 2.0 nōnsense, please.</p>
<p><strong>Wanted:</strong> This project originated in Japan, from
 the WIDE Project and itojun-sama. Some documentation is in Japanese,
 which I cannot update, given I sadly do not speak Japanese. If you
 can translate (or, even better, are an original MagicPoint developer
 wanting to join the fun), <em>please</em> contact me!</p>
