All rights reserved.

Provided that these terms and disclaimer and all copyright notices
are retained or reproduced in an accompanying document, permission
is granted to deal in this work without restriction, including un‐
limited rights to use, publicly perform, distribute, sell, modify,
merge, give away, or sublicence.

Neither the names of MirBSD and its subprojects nor of its contri‐
butors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the
work, or other products or opinions, without the owner’s specific,
prior, written permission. Any imaginery must not be used in a way
despicable to the depicted.

If this work or a derivate thereof is used on world wide web pages
the imprint of that site must give due credit to its authors.

This licence does not cover usage of the “look and feel” of either
the MirOS Project website or the personal home pages of authors or
contributors. Use of the marks “MirBSD”, “MirOS”, “MirPorts Frame‐
work”, or any other mark reserved by or for MirBSD (formerly MirOS
Project, and still inferred by any references to the old name), or
the visual marks used, such as the BSD Dæmon or the Shilouette Dæ‐
mon, is not licenced hereby either; website mirrors are allowed to
redistribute exact copies of our material, but other use of any of
the marks shown above or otherwise belonging to the Project or the
authors and contributors is not permitted.

This licence agreement shall be governed in all aspects by the law
of Germany; designated place of court is: Bonn, NRW, Germany — Der
Gerichtsstand ist Bonn, NRW, Deutschland. Es gilt deutsches Recht.

This work is provided “AS IS” and WITHOUT WARRANTY of any kind, to
the utmost extent permitted by applicable law, neither express nor
implied; without malicious intent or gross negligence. In no event
may a licensor, author or contributor be held liable for indirect,
direct, other damage, loss, or other issues arising in any way out
of dealing in the work, even if advised of the possibility of such
damage or existence of a defect, except proven that it results out
of said person’s immediate fault when using the work as intended.


Anyone is permitted to use the favicon.ico file under the
MirOS, ISC/OpenBSD, MIT, X11, UCB, or any BSD licence, or
the historic permission clause, as long as permission for
use of the BSD dæmon has been obtained from Marshall Kirk
McKusick.

The BSD dæmon is Copyright (c) 1988 by Marshall Kirk McKusick.
All Rights Reserved.  Individuals may use the daemon for their
personal use within the bounds of good taste.  When reasonably
possible, the text shown above is to be included.

The Shilouette dæmon is Copyright © 2003 by Rick Collette
The MirOS Project (succeeded by MirBSD) may freely use the former
ekkoBSD Logo, the shilouette Dæmon, for MirBSD, on anything the
project leader sees fit, so long as it pertains to MirBSD in some
way and the leader gives credit for the original dæmon to
Marshall Kirk McKusick.

Some of the artwork is Copyright © by Lukas (smultron@@) —
these are usually available under “any Creative Commons”.

The Hexley DarwinOS Mascot is Copyright (c) 2000 by Jon Hooper.
All Rights Reserved.
Permission to use the mascot may be obtained from:
Jon Hooper, 646 Luton Drive, Glendale CA 91206, USA

this image is granted, provided you acknowledge <lewing@@isc.tamu.edu> and
The GIMP <http://www.isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/gimp/> if asked.

The anargeek emblem contains an explicit licence embedded
in the SVG source code and a PNG zTXt chunk.

The CVSweb CGI script is covered by a two-clause UCB-sty‐
le BSD licence embedded in the source code.

The fonts used are covered by their own licences and used
with permission. Note that the look and feel clause above
may affect your ability to re-use them in derivates.

The xhtml11.dtd file is xhtml11-flat.dtd from W3C, updated
with the bugfixes from a later revision of the standard.
Debian #826213 has more licence grant.

Some parts of the site’s content — such as the translated
Anargeek manifesto or the HTML versions of the manual pa‐
ges and BSD documentation — are covered by different, si‐
milarily free licences. Refer there for details.
