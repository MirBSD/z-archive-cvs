This is a template of a modified* ISC licence, which the OpenBSD project
recommends for use by new code. The MirOS Project, however, recommends a
different licence, which can be seen at /usr/share/misc/licence.template
or http://mirbsd.de/MirOS-Licence if you have www access. This (ISC) li-
cence template has been placed at http://mirbsd.de/ISC-Licence as well.

*) The modification addresses a problem with the original template which
   allowed derivate works to strip the disclaimer. It is, however, safer
   to use the MirOS Licence Template (see above) anyway.
*) The second modification clarifies the word "and" in the first senten-
   ce into the "and/or" form by request of the Free Software Foundation.


It is important to specify the year of the copyright.  Additional years
should be separated by a comma, e.g.
    Copyright (c) 2003, 2004

If you add extra text to the body of the license, be careful not to
add further restrictions.

Note: Some older versions of this licence template were missing the text
"this permission notice" and used "and" instead of "and/or". This is not
recommended, see above.
