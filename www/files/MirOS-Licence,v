I̲N̲S̲T̲R̲U̲C̲T̲I̲O̲N̲S̲:̲
To apply the template⁽¹⁾ specify the years of copyright (separated by
comma, not as a range), the legal names of the copyright holders, and
the real names of the authors (and licensors, possibly) if different.
Avoid adding any text that could be read as further restriction.

R̲A̲T̲I̲O̲N̲A̲L̲E̲:̲
This licence is apt for any kind of work (such as source code, fonts,
documentation, graphics, sound etc.) and the preferred terms for work
added to MirBSD. It has been drafted as universally usable equivalent
of the “historic permission notice”⁽²⁾ adapted to Europen law because
some countries have specific requirements for disclaimers, and author
and licensor can differ in (droit d’auteur) legislations. The licence
conforms to DFSG⁽³⁾ 1.1, OKD⁽⁴⁾ 2.1, OSD⁽⁵⁾ 1.9, CSD⁽⁶⁾, qualifies as
a Free Software⁽⁷⁾ and Free Documentation⁽⁸⁾ licence, for Free Cultu‐
ral Works⁽⁹⁾, and is thus included in relevant lists⁽¹⁰⁾ of licences.
It’s also a licence suitable for OER and Open Content⁽¹⁸⁾.

The webpage⁽¹⁹⁾ for this licence contains further information as well
as additional resources such as translations.

OPTIONAL ADVERTISING CLAUSE:
Adding advertising clauses is not recommended because they accumulate
(MirOS #9 had 130 required acknowledgements, out of which several are
duplicates with only minor changes), but if this kind of crediting is
desired, the following mksh(1)-style (grouped by parentheses, separa-
ted by bars, parts can be omitted if prefixed by a question mark) ex-
pression provides a paragraph to be inserted between the two above:

 * (All a|A)dvertising materials mentioning features or use of this (
 * software|work) must display the following acknowledgement:
 *	This product includes (material|software) (provided by|devel-
 *	oped (at|?(or owned )by|under|for?( use (in|with)))) $name?(,
 *	)?( and (its|their|by other) contributors)?( (for|by) $name).

(but there is no implied choice of law; MirOS itself uses extra
 provisions to do that, these will however hinder compatibility
 with other licences and certification compliance, and restrict)

(This work, the "MirBSD Licence", is an artistic work drafted by the
 author, Thorsten "mirabilos" Glaser, under review and commentary by
 various persons. As such it is protected by droit d'auteur. As long
 as the author is credited, not endangered, and his name not abused,
 it can be used under the terms of this licence itself, e.g. for in-
 spiration, but we'd love you to use it verbatim for your own work.)
