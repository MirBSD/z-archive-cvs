$OpenBSD: license.template,v 1.2 2003/06/03 22:37:00 david Exp $

Below is an example license to be used for new code in OpenBSD,
modeled after the ISC license.

The MirOS Project however recommends a different licence template, look at
/usr/share/misc/licence.template or http://mirbsd.de/MirOS-Licence for details.

It is important to specify the year of the copyright.  Additional years
should be separated by a comma, e.g.
    Copyright (c) 2003, 2004

If you add extra text to the body of the license, be careful not to
add further restrictions.

IMPORTANT: It has been suggested to change the last part to read:
[...] notice, this permission notice and the disclaimer appear in [...]
The MirOS Project seconds this motion if you must use the ISC/OpenBSD
licence instead of the MirOS licence (see licence.template for that).
