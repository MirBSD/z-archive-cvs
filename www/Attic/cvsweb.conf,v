<p>
This is a WWW interface for CVS repositories.
You can browse the file hierarchy by following directory links (which
have slashes after them, e.g. <code>src/</code>).
If you follow a link to a file, you will see its revision history.
Following a link labeled with a revision number will display that
revision of the file.  In the revision history view, there is a link
near each revision to display diffs between that revision and the
previous one, and a form at the bottom of the page that allows you to
display diffs between arbitrary revisions.
</p><p>
This CVSweb script shows you the contents of the MirOS Project's CVS
repository. For further information about the MirOS Project please go
