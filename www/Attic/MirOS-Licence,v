 *
 * This work is provided "AS IS" and WITHOUT WARRANTY of any kind, to

 * of said person's immediate fault when using the work as intended.

(The licence template ends here, only read below for further information,
 and how to integrate an advertising clause, if you have to and want to.)

 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 * To apply the template[1] specify the years of copyright (separated
 * by comma, not as range), the legal names of the copyright holders,
 * and the real names of the authors if different. Avoid adding text.
 *
 * OPTIONAL ADVERTISING CLAUSE:
 * Adding advertising clauses is not recommended because they accumu-
 * late (MirOS #9 has a list of 130 required acknowledgements, out of
 * which several were duplicates with only minor changes) but if this
 * kind of crediting is desired, insert between the two paragraphs a-
 * bove the evaluation result of the following mksh(1)-style (grouped
 * by parentheses, separated by bars, can be omitted if prefixed by a
 * question mark) expression:
 *
 * (All a|A)dvertising materials mentioning features or use of this (
 * software|work) must display the following acknowledgement:
 *	This product includes (material|software) (provided by|devel-
 *	oped (at|?(or owned )by|under|for?( use (in|with)))) $name?(,
 *	)?( and (its|their|by other) contributors)?( (for|by) $name).
 *
 * RATIONALE:
 * This licence is apt for any kind of work (such as source code, do-
 * cumentation, fonts, graphics, sound, etc.) and the preferred terms
 * for works added to MirOS. It has been drafted as universally usab-
 * le equivalent of the "historic permission notice"[2] adapted to EU

(but there is no implied choice of law; MirOS itself uses extra
 provisions to do that, these will however hinder compatibility
 with other licences and certification compliance, and restrict)

 * law, because in some (droit d'auteur) countries one can't disclaim
 * all liabilities. Compliance to OSD[3] 1.9 and DFSG[4] 1.1 is safe,
 * and GPLv2 compatibility is asserted unless advertising clauses are
 * used or other (restrictive) text is added.
 *
 * We believe you are not liable for code inserted which is intellec-
 * tual property of third parties, if you were not aware of the fact,
 * act appropriately as soon as you become aware of this problem, and
 * seek an amicable solution for all parties.

(This work, the "MirBSD Licence", is an artistic work drafted by the
 author, Thorsten "mirabilos" Glaser, under review and commentary by
 various persons. As such it is protected by droit d'auteur. As long
 as the author is credited, not endangered, and his name not abused,
 it can be used under the terms of this licence itself, e.g. for in-
 spiration, but we'd love you to use it verbatim for your own work.)
