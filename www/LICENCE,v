The MirAbile logo (pics/logo-mirbsd.png) is property of Thorsten Glaser
and must not be used by anyone without an explicit written licence. It
is used on the website of the MirOS Project to represent "MirBSD" (the
predecessor of MirOS+MirPorts) and unmodified website mirrors are allowed
to display it for this purpose exactly as on the original website of the
MirOS Project and mirabile. Use the "MirOS Project" logo instead. Some
of the other images are also not freely available.
