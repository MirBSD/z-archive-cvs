<h1>Current MirOS News</h1><ul>

<li>05.07.2006<br />As you see above, this page is really orphaned. We did
	warn you. FYI, the former mirsolutions server is no longer. gecko2
	hosts (for money&#8230;) the box behind www.mirbsd.org now. waldis
	Zope is still operational and helps a lot.</li>

<li>23.04.2006<br />There might be a service outage on mirsolutions.de and
	mirbsd.org soonish. We will try to prepare backup NS/MX in advance
	and point the mirbsd.de redirector you should be using for any web
	stuff anyway to a working mirror. On some unrelated news, the live
	CD which will be distributed at LinuxTag 2006 is already up on the
	<a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent tracker</a>, I
	however recommend to get the CD there anyway if you can make it as
	we've revived the cool LinuxTag 2004 cover by Wokmann. The current
	live CD still does not have automatic serial console recognisation
	in the fancy boot manager, though.</li>

<li>11.04.2006<br />On <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent
	</a> there is a new snapshot available, which, for the first time,
	is a combined Live/Install CD. From now on, you can also cat(1) or
	dd(1) the ISO (either cdrom8.iso or the live/install ISO) onto the
	hard disc and just load it from there, without installboot(8/i386)
	needing to be run (it's included on the CD already). There are few
	bugs in this snapshot, some of which I already know and fixed. I'd
	appreciate everyone to test it and send in results, whether failed
	or succeeded (especially if there is a regression e.g. regarding a
	normal installation). Thanks!</li>

<li>older news:<br />Please read the <a href="/?irc">FreeForge IRC network
	information</a> as well.</li>

<li>27.03.2006<br />In case you have acquired a MirOS CD-ROM "FOSDEM 2006"
	edition please verify the checksums of the data on the CD. Some of
	the CDs we distributed at FOSDEM were burned from a bad ISO.</li>

</ul>
<p>For older news, please refer to the <a href="/?older">historical news
 page</a>, or the developers' weblog.</p>

<li>06.04.2006<br />The Ada and GCJ compilers are no longer delivered with
	MirOS-current. Users who require them must now build these drivers
	manually by changing <tt>/etc/make.cfg</tt> and building the "gcc"
	module. Note: GNAT (the Ada compiler of GCC) requires itself to be
	built (you can pull it from an older snapshot or #8-stable).</li>

<li>29.03.2006<br />We've added a new server to the Freeforge IRC network,
	<tt>herc.66h.42h.de</tt> Port 6668 (SSL), 6667 and 6666 (non-SSL).
	You can either directly connect to that server or the round-robin,
	<tt>irc.66h.42h.de</tt> (or <tt>irc4.66h.42h.de</tt> for IPv4-only
	or <tt>irc6.66h.42h.de</tt> for IPv6-only connections). Note: this
	server does have IPv6 connectivity, however it's only a SixXS over
	ADSL (consumer line) connection, so don't overload it.</li>

<li>19.03.2006<br />We've added a new server to the Freeforge IRC network,
	<tt>maou.66h.42h.de</tt> Port 6668 (SSL), 6667 and 6666 (non-SSL).
	You can either directly connect to that server or the round-robin,
	<tt>irc.66h.42h.de</tt> (or <tt>irc4.66h.42h.de</tt> for IPv4-only
	connections). We sit on channel <tt>#mirbsd</tt> and <tt>#bsd</tt>
	like before.</li>

<li>gzsig(1) keys have switched; the new one can be found in CAcert-signed
	<a href="/MirOS/gzsigkey.cer">PEM format</a> as well.</li>

<li>01.03.2006<br />Again success building a cross-compiler to i386 Debian
	GNU/Linux from MirOS (tested with printf(1) because GNU libc is an
	ugly piece of shit unable to build mksh(1) sh(1) date(1) etc.) but
	this time with GCC 3.4.6 and <tt>--with-sysroot</tt>.</li>

<li>26.02.2006<br />The MirOS Project glances by appearance at FOSDEM 2006
	and sells T-Shirts and CD-Rs of the latest snapshot which also has
	an upgraded OpenSSH.</li>

<li>21.02.2006<br />Improvements and bug fixes in the randomness area; the
	arc4random_add(3) function finally works as designed. PHP contains
	SQLite2; Midnight Commander has been updated after 3 years. ssh(1)
	was updated to OpenSSH-current and the code was cleaned up. Compat
	ports were fixed as well as bugs in the package upgrader. Keys for
	vnconfig(8) can now be stored in an external file. Access logs for
	httpd(8) are now stored in a different format displaying SSL infos
	(whether SSL was used and which crypto suite chosen).</li>

<li>15.02.2006<br />There is a <a href="/MirOS/current/i386-20060215/">new
	snapshot</a> with all the features below (attention: ssh/scp(1) is
	not updated regarding CVE-2006-0225 yet). There is also a new repo
	seed. Ports of this snapshot are not used to update #8 because the
	overall quality is in an unknown state.</li>

<li>30.01.2006<br />We now have an iconv(3) implementation by Citrus (from
	NetBSD&reg;) in the base system, used by lynx(1). There is also an
	nl_langinfo(CODESET) now which works.<br />Switched to use mmap(2)
	malloc(2), enjoy the breakage in third-party applications ;)<br />
	Security updates for perl(1) and the kernel. Updated mksh(1) also.
	We do not deliver precompiled perl header files any more.<br />gcc
	now complains if CFLAGS are not honoured.</li>

<li>26.01.2006<br />There are new, working, permanent homepages of both <a
	href="http://mirbsd.de/jupp">jupp</a> and the MirBSD korn shell <a
	href="http://mirbsd.de/mksh">mksh</a> these are redirections which
	are hosted in waldi's Zope and (usually) point to a working mirror
	just like for <a href="http://mirbsd.de/">MirOS itself</a> and the
	<a href="http://cvs.mirbsd.de/">MirOS CVSweb</a> redirector.<br />
	There is also a new version of jupp released, joe-3.1jupp5.</li>

<li>24.01.2006<br />Progress is being made both in ports as in base. A new
	snapshot is scheduled to be uploaded in a few days also fixing the
	HTML problems with the online manual pages.</li>

<li>20.01.2006<br />Some of the domain issues have been solved, and the #1
	well-known mirror (mirbsd.mirsolutions.de) is back up and running,
	although only with a kludge. Expect mirbsd.org to point to the new
	master server soonish, and some overhaul of the website content to
	reflect the changes. The old CVS repositories have been frozen and
	published as a cpio-ball (all three together); there will be zero,
	really no commits at all any more to ocvs.<br />The G**gle Ads are
	gone from the website and will cease to exist in the manual pages,
	too. They closed my account for supposed abuse which I (tg@@) can't
	have done (only installed opera afterwards to login and check if I
	can see something in the logs, couldn't login already), right when
	the first payment was about to be issued (accumulated some 100 USD
	in over 10 months), and do not react on my enquiring eMail at all.
	This just sucks, and they do owe me that money.<br />Check out the
	<a href="/?wlog-8">web log</a> too, it's a bit more active than in
	the past (not much though).<br />MirSirc has been updated in ports
	relative to the public preview, use that. A new <tt>/cvs</tt> cpio
	ball will be published quite soon, too.</li>

@Yes, I admit, I fucked up. The CVS server died because I killed, then
re-started the OpenVPN client on it. It ran for five minutes (earlier
the week, it even ran until I rebooted myself, so I thought: it might
be fine again. It wasn't. When I got home, I got a panic, but was un-
able to log it. Then I rebooted.

	upgrades (works for very simple setups).<br />CVS: finally, passes
	the CVSREADONLYFS environment variable (or -R flag) to the server,
	if using the :ext: protocol (rsh/ssh). Might break with quite some

<li>05.12.2005<br />Updated GNU CVS to 1.12.13; rewrote the scripts we use
	in /cvs/CVSROOT/ to generate changelogs and mails (maybe add later
	support for changesets in cvsweb). Shrink source tree (by removing
	unused tags and cleaning up the Attic). Re-enable bootfloppy.</li>

<li>04.12.2005<br />mksh R26 and new MirMake and CPIO versions are out and
	change big thing. The source tree has been fully merged; snapshots
	will be built again soon, preparations started.</li>

<li>20.11.2005<br />mksh R25b has been released, with support for MirOS #7
	and (new) Cygwin. The current versions of gcc-3.4 (stable) and gpc
	(GNU Pascal) have been imported, and bugs are being fixed. Work on
	ports has stabilised, the new infrastructure is ready.</li>

<li>17.11.2005<br />Work on LKMs has been done to the extent that they can
	be used again. make(1) now knows the <tt>.trace</tt> operation. In
	MirPorts you can now specify CVS server, tag/date and module paths
	as a &quot;pseudo distfile&quot; instead of rolling your own; they
	will still be checksummed. The pkgtools port has been converted to
	use this new mechanism; we'll see if it creates trouble.<br /> The
	new _anoncvs password on thor/mirsolutions.de is empty.</li>

<li>16.11.2005<br />The new MirPorts installer both works on all supported
	platforms now and has got a manual page. Several ports were fixed,
	updated and tested on some of the platforms; the infrastructure is
	further improved as well. Some helpers used during the build got a
	polish. Some annoying DEBUGLIBS and DEBUGPROGS bugs were fixed and
	the kernel and bootloader now work properly too. The long-standing
	timekeeping issues are all solved, the GNU mktime testsuite works.
	Some documentation has been updated. Work on I18N has continued as
	well as some more merging of OpenBSD. Lynx has been updated, and a
	bunch of OpenBSD ksh patches flew in. upkg, the MirOS setup manual
	page, and some other "old stuff" was touched again. Almost all our
	portable tools have had at least one new release.</li>

<li>03.10.2005<br />After about 2&frac12; years, our first mirror (in USA)
	goes offline. Thanks to bsdadvocacy.org for hosting us so long, at
	the very beginning even though the OpenBSD team disapproved.<br />
	Also, the etherkiller.de mirror disappeared, and the tamu.edu was,
	IIRC, taken offline some time ago. This means, at the moment there
	is only one, central, place to retrieve MirOS BSD (in Germany): <a
	href="https://mirbsd.mirsolutions.de:445/">mirbsd.mirsolutions.de</a><br />
	There has been some further work ongoing related to both the ports
	stuff (infrastructure fixes and port updates) and libc (it builds,
	but this is only a small step towards both I18N and unbreaking the
	current CVS HEAD).</li>

<li>20.08.2005<br />
	The MirPorts Framework now installs into <tt>/usr/mpkg</tt> on all
	platforms by default. This improves coexistence with other porting
	frameworks, such as the OpenBSD Ports Tree; simplifies cleaning up
	by removal of all installed packages; provides a consistent, among
	all platforms, interface; leaves <tt>/usr/local</tt> to the admin.
	Of course, this means, reinstallation is necessary.<br />Please to
	be keeping in mind that most ports (that were using libtool) still
	need to be updated.</li>

<li>09.08.2005<br />
	The <a href="http://wiki.mirbsd.de/">MirWiki</a> is read-only, for
	a transition phase. The content will be merged into the main page,
	as time permits. After that, it will be shut down entirely.</li>

<li>02.08.2005<br />
	MirOS hasn't stopped, it's just progressing slowly because current
	development is progressing in rather big steps. There is a status,
	mirror and "all-in-one overview" page now which we will keep up to
	date if no other one. There are also some hardware issues to solve
	(such as a broken Socket 7 fan, and a non-working coffee machine),
	but we will continue development and fighting lobbyism, politician
	nonsense etc.<br />mksh R24 has been released some time ago and is
	the first one who actually made it into Debian testing, hooray!</li>

<li>06.07.2005<br />
	The European Parliament has finally stopped patents on algorithms,
	data structures and business models. MirOS has gained speed, USB 2
	support and probably a few other things, among more stability. The
	MirPorts Framework is undergoing an infrastructural change of deep
	impact; we will keep you informed. The MirWiki is about to be shut
	down end of July, 2005; content will be merged back into the MirOS
	website (www module); this is due to lack of interest.</li>

<li>26.05.2005<br />
	<a href="http://wiki.mirbsd.de/MirbsdKsh">mksh</a> R22 is formally
	released; this is the latest version of our portable shell sources
	which we consider stable.<br />Most in-tree issues for the release
	have settled down; there is still some work to do in the upgrading
	third-party stuff (gcc, binutils, gdb, lynx) development. It's not
	adviced to download the current sources and compile it yourself at
	this time. (Update: R22c, some portability fixes.)</li>

<li>05.05.2005<br />
	K7 PowerNow support has been greatly revamped, the PST used can be
	chosen at UKC time now. A third release candidate should have been
	uploaded but could not due to a server defect. The main CVS server
	was updated with MirOS #8 RC3, and we use the new commitid feature
	of GNU CVS 1.12.12 extensively now. Expect a fourth candidate seen
	on the BitTorrent servers soon.</li>

<li>03.05.2005<br />
	Yesterday's Snapshot comes with a broken httpd(8) that is fixed in
	HEAD, and a broken gij(1) for which I cannot imagine a fix. Please
	help investigating if you know GCJ.</li>

<li>25.04.2005<br />
	MirOS-current (no snapshot yet) fixes the C++ problems, it's now a
	fully supported programming language (leaving only GCJ open for my
	desires &ndash; that's the reason gcc is built after X11 by a make
	dist, by the way). It also contains some other minor yet important
	fixes, but there's still an update of a component pending before a
	new snapshot can be released.</li>

<li>20.04.2005<br />
	We're closer to solving that X/GLX problem, thanks to David Dawes,
	who is tracking it down to threads at the moment. The promised new
	<a href="/?clog-2005#snap0420">snapshot</a> is available as usual,
	via the BitTorrent tracker. Direct downloads should work soon too.
	Please report functional installs but especially failures, to help
	making MirOS #8 the best release ever.</li>

<li>19.04.2005<br />
	The current development version of MirOS has received numerous bug
	fixes in gcc, XFree86&reg; and others over the last few days. Also
	the in-tree CVS has been updated to fix a security issue, which <a
	href="https://ccvs.cvshome.org/servlets/NewsItemView?newsItemID=142">is
	described at the CVS homepage</a> and has got new features able to
	improve our infrastructure. Furthermore, after a long period of no
	port being available, the GNU Debugger is now integrated in MirOS,
	as part of GNU Binutils, again (we are using a development version
	from January 2005). Only CLI for now, the TUI requires, as of now,
	linking against GNU libreadline which does not come with MirOS any
	more. Fixes for libedit are probably easy.<br />The fixes are made
	available via a new development snapshot, which is currently being
	built and expected to hit the mirrors within the next 2 days.</li>

<li>12.04.2005<br />
	There has been a new release of MirMake, along with distfiles for:
	MirCksum (tested, ports/essentials/cksum), MirNroff (untested). If
	you use MirPorts/Darwin, you must execute the installation script,
	<tt>ports/infrastructure/install/Setup-Darwin.sh</tt>, again.</li>

<li>30.03.2005<br />
	Today we present a new, binary and source, snapshot to the general
	public. This snapshot comes with i386 binaries, source code for X,
	the base system (including gnu and gcc) as well as the latest cool
	MirPorts checkout. It's available for retrieval at the usual place
	as well as our <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent
	tracker</a> (while there, don't forget to donate the sysop of this
	tracker because he is giving this service to us for free). Also, a
	new CVS Repository snapshot has been published.<br />These are all
	signed using the new personal PGP key of developer tg@@ that should
	be available from the public keyserver network, for example at the
	DFN-PCA keyserver.<br />C++ support is included, yet still (except
	for xlock) not working correctly due to a GCC bug.</li>

<li>28.03.2005<br />
	The MirOS Project proudly announces that MirPorts is open for both
	using and modifying again and the transition to the new repository
	has finished successfully. Several ports have been updated, mostly
	to newer versions than OpenBSD 3.7-current has to offer.<br />Also
	GCC 3.4 is now almost feature-complete, with C, Objective-C, gcov,
	protoize, unprotoize, Pascal, Ada and C++ support in the compiler,
	leaving only java missing; with support libraries for all of these
	front-ends &ndash; however, libstdc++-v3 is still slightly broken,
	meaning anything which uses iostreams dumps core, we'll leave that
	to fix for someone who actually knows what templates are.<br />The
	C++ breakage does not affect libGLU and xlock, the latter thus now
	comes with all OpenGL modi as well.</li>

<li>25.03.2005<br />
	We have imported gcc 3.4-stable (20050325), currently working with
	the C, Ada, Objective-C and C++ front-ends and Ada and Objective-C
	support libraries. Support for exception handling through a shared
	libgcc has been written and is currently being tested. After C++'s
	support library has been added a new feature snapshot will be made
	available to the general public for testing.</li>

<li>22.03.2005<br />
	The MirOS Project has obtained a new logo to identify the project.
	It will look quite familiar for a couple of you, but we obtained a
	full permit to identify it with anything MirBSD&trade;.<br />Also,
	the GNU Compiler Collection 3.4.4 has made it into the source tree
	and is being ported; XFree86&reg; has been contacted.</li>

<li>20.03.2005<br />
	We have updated our XFree86&trade; to the recently released 4.5.0,
	with only minor breakage along the way. Also, MirPorts are getting
	fixed by bsiegert@@ after the transition to the new CVS repository.
	This means the next snapshot will rock even more, especially since
	X11 is built using systrace now, too; we'd appreciate if our users
	were going to test them hard and help fixing problems.<br />As for
	the website design changes: it's not yet finished, but we're still
	waiting for delivery of the new images. Stay tuned.</li>

<li>06.03.2005<br />
	<tt>mirbsd.org</tt> has been freed and saved from the hands of the
	evil OpenBSD force who announced in a primitive video that they'll
	put some new pictures on there. It has since been sponsored to the
	MirOS Project (but, similar to <tt>mirbsd.de</tt>, does not belong
	to a project member). Both second-level domains are content-filled
	from a Zope system run by the owner of <tt>mirbsd.de</tt>, where 2
	project members are content admins.</li>

<li>28.02.2005<br />
	We're back from FOSDEM. MirPorts work on Mac OSX now, but only for
	ports <b>without</b> a <tt>PFRAG.shared</tt>!<br />Update 02.03.05
	<br />There is basic support for <tt>PFRAG.dylib</tt> in place, so
	Midnight Commander (including libglib, autoconf 2.13 and 2.59, and
	help2man, works &ndash; this includes MirLibtool)!</li>

<li>05.02.2005<br />
	The (final) new CVS repository has been started; the modules "www"
	and "contrib" have been fully merged over, "src" and "X11" started
	and "gcc" and "ports" will follow. <a href="/cvs.cgi/">CVSweb</a>,
	still lacking adequate functionality to directly display ChangeLog
	links (we work around it now), has been updated and enhanced.</li>

<li>22.01.2005<br />
	We're almost through with the new directory structure, CVS and GCC
	versions and various stages of merging and fixing. SSH still dumps
	core after exiting (forced by ProPolice), but there will be a peek
	into the new technology available for download later, which closes
	our work on ncvs I and leads to opening ncvs II back at herc.</li>

<li>07.01.2005<br />
	Benny has formally released <a href="/?ann-7">#7quinquies</a> for
	the i386 platform (build sparc from #7-stable source after having
	installed #7quater) and Thorsten fixed up the MirOS BSD kernel to
	build with gcc 3.4 and merged much more code into ncvs.</li>

<li>05.01.2005<br />
	Happy new year to all MirOS users! We've just returned from 21C3,
	the first MirHackathon's location, where we successfully built a
	macppc system cross. This night, tg@@ has also successfully built
	a local gcc 3.4 (still without ProPolice, but progressing fast).
	An exciting number of new features <b>and</b> bug fixes is being
	made in the different (and confusing) CVS branches. Stay tuned!</li>
