<h1>Project Ideas</h1>

<p>The following project ideas can be submitted to the MirOS Project
 by everybody who feels like having the necessary skills.
 To avoid duplicate work, we suggest the applicant to <a
 href="mailto:miros-discuss@@mirbsd.org">contact</a> us first.</p>

<p>Submissions ought to be made under the <a href="/?licence">MirOS
 Licence</a>, but any other licence which is equivalent to the UCB/BSD
 licence is OK. We suggest to not add advertising clauses, though.</p>

<h2>List of ideas</h2><ul>

<li>Fix annoying bugs in nroff, especially these which prevent it from
 outputting correctly formatted manual pages when not built with -O1 or
 -fno-omit-frame-pointer on gcc 3.4-stable snapshots (even on Debian).
 If the code is also cleaned up a bit, chances are it will make into
 stock OpenBSD at least for plain nroff support. Also, ask Brian Kerninghan
 for a licence for ditroff, start hacking on it instead (tg@@ has got the
 sources, they just lack a licence and copyright marker).<br />
 The first bug you should look at is even exposed when using -O1:<pre>
	On a side note: does anyone who is experienced in C
	and gdb (I'm not familiar with the latter...) want to
	fix the bugs in src/usr.bin/oldroff/nroff/ which make
	it show
	|     The options that operate on the names of files or archive members
	|     (-c,-i, -n, -s, -u, -v, -D, -G, -T, -U, -Y, and -Z) interact as follows.
	in the pax(1) manual page, instead of (hand-edited)
	|     The options that operate on the names of files or archive members (-c,
	|     -i, -n, -s, -u, -v, -D, -G, -T, -U, -Y, and -Z) interact as follows.
	or, depending on the line length,
	|     The options that operate on the names of files or archive members
	|     (-c, -i, -n, -s, -u, -v, -D, -G, -T, -U, -Y, and -Z) interact as follows.

	This is .Po and .Pc, all others (.Qo/.Qc and so on) are
	broken the same way, and it gets worse if you build nroff
	with -O2/-Os instead of -O1 (-funit-at-a-time also exhibits
	the bug, but this time I'm convinced it's a bug in nroff).
 </pre>(from an eMail)<br />

 Estimated effort: Time - medium; Skill - low</li>

<li>Port MirOS BSD to the Xen machine virtualisation technique. This can
 probably be done by looking at the NetBSD code and giving credit
 where due. Domain U and Xen 2.0 support is a must; Domain 0 support
 would be an additional bonus.<br />
 We would like to not need src/sys/arch/xen, rather keep it integrated
 in src/sys/arch/i386, except for the Xen-specific device drivers,
 which can go to src/sys/arch/i386/xen/ (DomU drivers).<br />

 Estimated effort: Time - high; Skill - medium</li>

<li>Port FFS snapshots support to MirOS BSD. In addition to that, port at
 least one of UBC (unified buffer cache) or UFS2 support. Again, this
 can be made quite easily by looking at how NetBSD has done it; in
 addition, Ted Unangst of OpenBSD has published some experimental diffs
 to the OpenBSD mailing lists.<br />

 Estimated effort: Time - medium; Skill - medium (high if UBC)</li>

<li>Add support for IPv4 mapped IPv6 addresses to MirOS BSD, controllable
 with a sysctl (net.inet6.ip6.v6only), so that, if the sysctl is set
 to 0, a daemon listening on (say) [::]:53 will receive IPv4-transport
 (on the wire) packets as IPv6-mapped (in the protocol stack) connections
 and is able to process them without having to listen to [0.0.0.0]:53 as
 well. Keep care that these IPv4-mapped IPv6 packets are never seen on
 the wire, and that IPv4-mapped packets seen on the wire are always
 discarded, for security reasons.<br />

 Estimated effort: Time - medium; Skill - medium</li>

<li>Communicate with upstream and send back diffs. This is urgent for
 XFree86&reg;, high priority for GNU binutils; low priority for all
 other stuff (probably not interesting for gcc at all). The project
 assignee will have to make himself familiar with the MirOS-local
 diffs first &ndash; not always an easy task because we inherited a
 lot of them from OpenBSD. (Optionally, add support for cross-building
 to OpenBSD targets first.)<br />

 Estimated effort: Time - medium to high; Skill - low but specialised</li>

<li>Merge improvements from NetBSD&reg; &ndash; especially in the
 following fields: make(1); binutils and gcc (so we can cross-build
 to all or almost all NetBSD&reg; targets); ...<br />

 Estimated effort: Time - medium to high; Skill - medium</li>

</ul>

<h2>Implementation notes</h2>

<p>Unless we are accepted as a mentoring organisation at Google's
 &quot;Summer of Code&quot; we are sorry we cannot offer a bounty
 for completion of these tasks. We are trying, though.</p>

<p>People working on the above projects will be listed there so you
 can contact them if required.</p>
