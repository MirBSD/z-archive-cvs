@* remove ctm, we don't use/support it at the moment,
  unslack base, and the code isn't audited anyway
* remove netgroup_mkdb, it doesn't suit MirOS' target
  audience (only makes sense in large/YP? environments)
* comment out ifstated, people might use ifwatchd instead,
  ifstated can't be used for pppoe(8) anyway; will be back
  on complaints, nuked else
