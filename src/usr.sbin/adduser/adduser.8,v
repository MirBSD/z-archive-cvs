@make it harder to accidentally set empty passwords on logins:
if the password is empty, we already ask if the account is to
be disabled (/sbin/nologin as shell); if not, use the special
string "skey" as password instead (for SSH key logins etc).

.Sh NAME
.Nm adduser
.Nd create new users with a text-driven menu interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates a user with a group whose name and GID
correspond to the user's name and UID, and populates his
home directory with the contents of
.Pa /etc/skel .
The user is by default put into the login class
.Dq default ,
has no password timeouts, secondary groups, or other special options.
.Pp
To change the login class, use the following command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ sudo vipw
.Ed
.Pp
To add a user to a secondary group or remove him from any groups,
or to add not yet existing groups, use the following command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ sudoedit /etc/group
.Ed
.Pp
Users and groups are never removed. To disable a user, change his
login class to default (empty field), his home directory to
.Pa /nonexistant ,
and his shell to
.Pa /sbin/nologin .
Remove his former home directory and set the password so that the
user cannot login any more (only an asterisk), but do not delete
the entry.

.Xr mksh 1 ,
.Xr passwd 1 ,
.Xr group 5 ,
.Xr login.conf 5 ,

.Xr vipw 8
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in
.Mx 10 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.Nm
was written by
.An Thorsten Glaser Aq tg@@mirbsd.de .
.Sh CAVEATS
.Mx 8
and previous had a complex user-management suite mixed from
shell, perl, and C code, with an added advertising clause,
and many more unneeded functions.
It is recommended to never delete users and groups, just disable them,
anyway, so that the UIDs and GIDs will not be reused.
This utility scans for collisions with both UIDs and GIDs, so that,
in practice, retaining the group is enough.
.Pp
Changing the login class or group memberships of a user, as well as
group management, must be done manually by using
.Nm vipw
and editing
.Pa /etc/group ,
respectively.
This is actually by design.
.Pp
To make an S/Key- or SSH public key only user account, set his password
field to the string
.Dq skey
using
.Nm vipw ,
or use an empty password and answer
.Dq no
when asked if the user should be prevented from logging in,
to prevent the daily cron job's security checks from complaining.

.Nm adduser
program adds new users to the system.
The
.Nm rmuser
program removes users from the system.
When not passed any arguments, both
utilities operate in interactive mode and prompt for any required information.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Fl batch Ar username
.Oo Ar group Ns Op , Ns Ar group
.Ar ... Oc
.Op Ar fullname
.Op Ar password
.Xc
Enter batch mode in which multiple users are specified on the command-line
in a compact format.
By default the password is assumed to already be properly encrypted.
.It Fl check_only
Check the passwd, group, and shells databases for consistency and problems
then exit without performing any other operation.
.It Fl class Ar login_class
Use the specified
.Ar login_class
as the default user login class.
See
.Xr login.conf 5
for further details.
.It Fl config_create
Create or edit default configuration information and message file before
proceeding with the normal interactive adduser procedure.
.It Fl dotdir Ar directory
Copy files from
.Ar directory
into the HOME directory of new users.
Files named in the fashion of
.Dq Pa dot.foo
will be renamed to
.Dq Pa .foo .
By default, all files are made writable and readable by
their owner.
.\" don't allow group or world to write files and allow only owner
.\" to read/execute/write .rhost, .Xauthority, .kermrc, .netrc, Mail,
.\" prv, iscreen, term.
.It Fl encryption , e Ar method
Encrypt local passwords using
.Ar method
of encryption as described in
.Xr login.conf 5 .
If
.Ar method
is
.Dq auto ,
the encryption type will be derived from the user's login class.
.It Fl group Ar login_group
Specify the default login group.
A value of
.Ar USER
means that the username is to be used as the login group.
.It Fl help , h , \&?
Print a summary of options and exit.
.It Fl home Ar partition
Specify the default home partition where all users' home directories
are to be located.
.It Fl message Ar file
Send new users a welcome message from
.Ar file .
Specifying a value of
.Dq no
for
.Ar file
causes no message to be sent to new users.
.It Fl noconfig
Do not read the default configuration file.
.It Fl shell Ar shell
Specify the default shell for new users.
.It Xo
.Fl silent , s ,
.Fl quiet , q
.Xc
Causes the program to print fewer warnings, questions, and bug reports.
.It Fl uid_start Ar uid
Use UIDs from
.Ar uid
up when automatically generating UIDs.
.It Fl uid_end Ar uid
Do not use UIDs higher than
.Ar uid
when generating UIDs.
.It Fl unencrypted
Causes the program to assume that the password given in batch mode is
unencrypted.
The password will be encrypted before being added to the password file.
Use of this option is discouraged, as the username and cleartext password
will appear in the process list, which is visible to users.
.It Fl verbose , v
Causes the program to print many warnings and questions.
This option is recommended for novice users.
.El
.Pp
.Nm adduser
first performs consistency checks on the password, group, and shell databases.
This includes finding any duplicate user or group names, illegal shells, or
shells that aren't executable.
Once these tests are passed,
d37 18
a54 173
performs the following operations for each new user:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
Add the appropriate entries to the password and group files and re-generate
the password database using
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8 .
.It
Create a home directory and copy all files from the skeletal
login directory (normally
.Pa /etc/skel )
to this new directory.
Files named in the fashion of
.Dq Pa dot.foo
will be renamed to
.Dq Pa .foo
in the new directory.
.It
Mails the new user a welcome message at the discretion of the account creator.
.El
.Pp
Similarly, when removing a user,
.Nm rmuser
performs the following operations for the given
.Ar username :
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
Removes any
.Xr crontab 1
entries or
.Xr at 1
jobs belonging to the user.
.It
Removes the user from the password database and all groups in the group
database.
If a group becomes empty and its name is the same as the username,
the group is removed (this complements
.Nm adduser Ns 's
unique per-user groups).
.It
Recursively deletes all files in the user's home directory and removes the
directory itself (provided the directory actually belongs to the user).
.Nm rmuser
prompts for confirmation before actually doing this.
.It
Removes the user's incoming mail file if one exists.
.El
.Pp
Understandably,
.Nm rmuser
politely refuses to remove users whose UID is 0 (typically root).
.Sh RESTRICTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy username
It is recommended that login names contain only lowercase characters
and digits.
They may also contain uppercase characters, non-leading hyphens,
periods, and a trailing '$'.
Login names may not be longer than 31 characters (see BUGS section of
.Xr setlogin 2 ) .
.\" The reasons for this limit are "Historical".
.\" Given that people have traditionally wanted to break this
.\" limit for aesthetic reasons, it's never been of great importance to break
.\" such a basic fundamental parameter in UNIX.
.\" You can change UT_NAMESIZE in /usr/include/utmp.h and recompile the
.\" world; people have done this and it works, but you will have problems
.\" with any precompiled programs, or source that assumes the 8-character
.\" name limit and NIS. The NIS protocol mandates an 8-character username.
If you need a longer login name for e-mail addresses,
you can define an alias in
.Pa /etc/mail/aliases .
.It Sy fullname
This should contain the user's first name and surname.
The
.Ql \&:
is not permitted.
.It Sy login_class
The specified user login class
must exist in
.Pa /etc/login.conf .
.It Sy shell
Only valid entries from the
.Xr shells 5
database or entries corresponding to
.Xr sliplogin 8
and
.Xr pppd 8
are permitted.
.It Sy uid_start
This value is the start of the range where free UID values are
searched for.
This value must be less than the value of uid_end.
The default value is 1000 or as configured in the configuration file.
.It Sy uid_end
This value is the end of the range where free UID values are
searched for.
This value must be more than the value of uid_start.
The default value is 2147483647 or as configured in the configuration file.
.It Sy gid/login group
This value is generated automatically, but can be specified at the
discretion of the person invoking the program.
.It Sy password
If not empty, the password is encrypted according to
.Xr login.conf 5 .
If empty, the account will be automatically disabled to prevent spurious
access to it.
.El
.\" .Sh UNIQUE GROUP
.\" Perhaps you're missing what *can* be done with this scheme that falls apart
.\" with most other schemes.  With each user in his/her own group the user can
.\" safely run with a umask of 002 and have files created in their home
.\" directory and not worry about others being able to read them.
.\"
.\" For a shared area you create a separate uid/gid (like cvs or ncvs on
.\" freefall) you place each person that should be able to access this area
.\" into that new group.
.\"
.\" This model of uid/gid administration allows far greater flexibility than
.\" lumping users into groups and having to muck with the umask when working
.\" in a shared area.
.\"
.\" I have been using this model for almost 10 years and found that it works
.\" for most situations, and has never gotten in the way.  (Rod Grimes)
