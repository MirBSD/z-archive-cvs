.Sh NAME
.Nm logresolve
.Nd resolve hostnames for IP adresses in Apache logfiles
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm logresolve
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl s Ar filename
\*(Lt
.Ar access_log
\*(Gt
.Ar access_log.new
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a post-processing program to resolve IP adresses in
.Xr httpd 8 Ns 's
access logfiles.
To minimize impact on the nameserver,
.Nm
has its very own internal hash-table cache.
This means that each IP number will only be looked up the first time it
is found in the log file.
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "-s filenameXX"
.It Fl c
This causes
.Nm
to apply some DNS checks:
after finding the hostname from the IP address, it looks up the IP
addresses for the hostname and checks that one of them matches the
original address.
.It Fl s Ar filename
Specifies the
.Ar filename
to record statistics.

@Import security fixes from OpenBSD httpd:

Fix mod_status XSS CVE-2007-6388:
A flaw was found in the mod_status module. On sites where mod_status
is enabled and the status pages were publicly accessible, a cross-site
scripting attack is possible. Note that the server-status page is
not enabled by default and it is best practice to not make this
publicly available.

Fix mod_imap XSS CVE-2007-5000:
A flaw was found in the mod_imap module. On sites where mod_imap
is enabled and an imagemap file is publicly available, a cross-site
scripting attack is possible.
