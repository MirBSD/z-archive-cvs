This is MirOS httpd, based upon Apache(TM) httpd and OpenBSD httpd,
which in turn is based upon Apache(TM) httpd, which is based upon
NCSA Mosaic. Although there are still many references to Apache(TM)
in the source code and especially (orphaned) documentation, MirOS
httpd is not endorsed nor supported by the Apache(TM) Foundation.

This work includes huge amounts of copyrighted work by the KAME
Project, Japan and the MirOS Project, Germany.
