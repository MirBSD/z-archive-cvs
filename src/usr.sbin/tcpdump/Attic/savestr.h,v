@remove tcpdump, as I don't want to be in violation of the
new §202c StGB (German penal code), which I hereby oppose
but still have to formally obey.

I hope this is the only thing in base we could offend the
criminal persecutors with; we'll provide a port for it as
a way to shoot yourself into the foot but will not be le-
gally able to provide it ourselves. (As far as I'm infor-
med, existing installations and historic codebases aren't
affected as the law has yet to become effective.) It's an
utterly stupid law passed against experts' opinions, but…

Anyway, this code was ugly and a security nightmare.
