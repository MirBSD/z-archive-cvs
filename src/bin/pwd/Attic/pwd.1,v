@• more comment and int→bool cleanup, add and improve some comments
• in interactive mode, always look up {LC_{ALL,CTYPE},LANG} environment
  variables if setlocale/nl_langinfo(CODESET) doesn’t suffice
• add the ability to call any builtin (some don't make sense or wouldn't
  work) directly by analysing argv[0]
• for direct builtin calls, the {LC_{ALL,CTYPE},LANG} environment
  variables determine utf8-mode, even if MKSH_ASSUME_UTF8 was set
• when called as builtin, echo behaves POSIXish
• add domainname as alias for true on MirBSD only, to be able to link it
• sync mksh Makefiles with Build.sh output
• adjust manpage wrt release plans
• link some things to mksh now that we have callable builtins:
  bin/echo bin/kill bin/pwd bin/sleep (exact matches)
  bin/test bin/[ (were scripts before)
  bin/domainname=usr/bin/true usr/bin/false (move to /bin/ now)
• drop linked utilities and, except for echo and kill, their manpages
• adjust instbin and link a few more there as well

.Sh NAME
.Nm pwd
.Nd return working directory name
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pwd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prints the absolute pathname of the current working directory to
the standard output.
Both the Bourne shell
.Pq Xr sh 1
and Korn shell
.Pq Xr ksh 1
have their own built-in version of
.Nm pwd .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cd 1 ,
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr ksh 1 ,
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr getcwd 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compatible.
.Sh BUGS
In
.Xr csh 1 ,
the command
.Ic dirs
is always faster (although it can give a different answer in the rare case
that the current directory or a containing directory was moved after
the shell descended into it).
