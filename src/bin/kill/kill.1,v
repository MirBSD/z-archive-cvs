@• more comment and int→bool cleanup, add and improve some comments
• in interactive mode, always look up {LC_{ALL,CTYPE},LANG} environment
  variables if setlocale/nl_langinfo(CODESET) doesn’t suffice
• add the ability to call any builtin (some don't make sense or wouldn't
  work) directly by analysing argv[0]
• for direct builtin calls, the {LC_{ALL,CTYPE},LANG} environment
  variables determine utf8-mode, even if MKSH_ASSUME_UTF8 was set
• when called as builtin, echo behaves POSIXish
• add domainname as alias for true on MirBSD only, to be able to link it
• sync mksh Makefiles with Build.sh output
• adjust manpage wrt release plans
• link some things to mksh now that we have callable builtins:
  bin/echo bin/kill bin/pwd bin/sleep (exact matches)
  bin/test bin/[ (were scripts before)
  bin/domainname=usr/bin/true usr/bin/false (move to /bin/ now)
• drop linked utilities and, except for echo and kill, their manpages
• adjust instbin and link a few more there as well

.Sh NAME
.Nm kill
.Nd terminate or signal a process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kill
.Op Fl s Ar signal_name
.Ar pid
.Op Ar ...
.Nm kill
.Fl l
.Op Ar exit_status
.Nm kill
.Fl Ar signal_name
.Ar pid
.Op Ar ...
.Nm kill
.Fl Ar signal_number
.Ar pid
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility sends a signal to the process(es) specified
by the
.Ar pid
operand(s).
If no signal is specified,
.Dv SIGTERM
is used.
.Pp
Only the superuser may send signals to other users' processes.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl s Ar signal_name
A symbolic signal name specifying the signal to be sent instead of the
default
.Dv SIGTERM .
.It Fl l Op Ar exit_status
If no operand is given, list the signal names; otherwise, write
the signal name corresponding to
.Ar exit_status .
.It Fl Ar signal_name
A symbolic signal name specifying the signal to be sent instead of the
default
.Dv SIGTERM .
.It Fl Ar signal_number
A non-negative decimal integer specifying the signal to be sent instead
of the default
.Dv SIGTERM .
.El
.Pp
The following PIDs have special meanings:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It \-1
If superuser, broadcast the signal to all processes; otherwise, broadcast
to all processes belonging to the user.
.It \- Ns Ar pgid
Send the signal to all processes within the specified process group.
.El
.Pp
Some of the more commonly used signals:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It 1
HUP (hang up)
.It 2
INT (interrupt)
.It 3
QUIT (quit)
.It 6
ABRT (abort)
.It 9
KILL (non-catchable, non-ignorable kill)
.It 14
ALRM (alarm clock)
.It 15
TERM (software termination signal)
.El
.Pp
For a more complete list, consult the
.Xr sigaction 2
manual page.
.Pp
A signal number of 0
.Pq Li kill \-0 pid
checks the validity of a certain PID, to see if it exists.
An exit code of 0 means that the specified process exists.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exists as a built-in to most shells;
they allow job specifiers of the form
.Dq %...
as arguments,
so process IDs are not as often used as
.Nm
arguments.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Forcibly terminate process ID 1234:
.Pp
.Dl $ kill -9 1234
.Pp
Send the
.Xr inetd 8
daemon the hangup signal, instructing it to re-read its configuration from
.Pa /etc/inetd.conf :
.Pp
.Dl $ sudo kill -HUP $(cat /var/run/inetd.pid)
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr pkill 1 ,
.Xr ps 1 ,
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr kill 2 ,
.Xr sigaction 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compatible.
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v3 .
It is actually an
.Nm mksh
builtin in
.Mx 11 .
