.Sh NAME
.Nm df
.Nd display free disk space
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm df
.Op Fl iklnP
.Op Fl t Ar type
.Oo
.Op Ar file | filesystem
.Ar ...
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the
specified
.Ar filesystem
or on the filesystem of which
.Ar file
is a part.
By default, values are displayed as 512-byte block counts.
If neither a file nor a
.Ar filesystem
operand is specified,
statistics for all mounted filesystems are displayed
(subject to the
.Fl l
and
.Fl t
options below).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Include statistics on the number of free inodes.
.It Fl k
By default, all sizes are reported in 512-byte block counts.
The
.Fl k
option causes the numbers to be reported in kilobyte counts.
.It Fl l
Display statistics only about mounted filesystems with the
.Dv MNT_LOCAL
flag set.
If a non-local filesystem is given as an argument, a
warning is issued and no information is given on that filesystem.
.It Fl n
Print out the previously obtained statistics from the filesystems.
This option should be used if it is possible that one or more
filesystems are in a state such that they will not be able to provide
statistics without a long delay.
When this option is specified,
.Nm
will not request new statistics from the filesystems, but will respond
with the possibly stale statistics that were previously obtained.
.It Fl P
Print out information in a stricter format designed to be parsed
by portable scripts.
.It Fl t Ar type
Indicate the actions should only be taken on
filesystems of the specified
.Ar type .
More than one type may be specified in a comma-separated list.
The list of filesystem types can be prefixed with
.Dq no
to specify the filesystem types for which action should
.Em not
be taken.
If a filesystem is given on the command line that is not of
the specified type, a warning is issued and no information is given on
that filesystem.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
If the environment variable
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is set, and the
.Fl k
options are not specified, the block counts will be displayed in units of that
size block.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Li $ df -kP /usr
.Pp
Output, in a strict format suitable for portable scripts, disk space
statistics for the
.Pa /usr
filesystem using kilobyte block sizes.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Li 0
Successful completion.
.It Li \*(Gt0
An error occurred.

utility is compliant with the

specification.

A

@* merge bin and lib completely
* convert some ancient RCSID styles etc. to more modern stuff
* fix use of CDIAGFLAGS+=, CFLAGS+= and COPTS+= to the correct
  variant (include bsd.own.mk _then_ COPTS+=) so they're added
  after any user-specified flags
  (this is probably lurking in more places than I can imagine)
* fix some indenting, comments, etc.
* make stuff compile (fix warnings/errors)
* add script to review _all_ shlib_version after an openbsd import
* remove two more obsolete /usr/lib/debug/ references
* bin/ps: comment out some SMP code
