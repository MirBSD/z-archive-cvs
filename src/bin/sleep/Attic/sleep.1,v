@• more comment and int→bool cleanup, add and improve some comments
• in interactive mode, always look up {LC_{ALL,CTYPE},LANG} environment
  variables if setlocale/nl_langinfo(CODESET) doesn’t suffice
• add the ability to call any builtin (some don't make sense or wouldn't
  work) directly by analysing argv[0]
• for direct builtin calls, the {LC_{ALL,CTYPE},LANG} environment
  variables determine utf8-mode, even if MKSH_ASSUME_UTF8 was set
• when called as builtin, echo behaves POSIXish
• add domainname as alias for true on MirBSD only, to be able to link it
• sync mksh Makefiles with Build.sh output
• adjust manpage wrt release plans
• link some things to mksh now that we have callable builtins:
  bin/echo bin/kill bin/pwd bin/sleep (exact matches)
  bin/test bin/[ (were scripts before)
  bin/domainname=usr/bin/true usr/bin/false (move to /bin/ now)
• drop linked utilities and, except for echo and kill, their manpages
• adjust instbin and link a few more there as well

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sleep
.Nd suspend execution for an interval of time
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm sleep
.Ar seconds
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
suspends execution for a minimum of the specified number of
.Ar seconds .
This number must be positive and may contain a decimal fraction.
.Nm
is commonly used to schedule the execution of other commands (see below).
.Sh EXAMPLES
Wait a half hour before running the script
.Pa command_file
(see also the
.Xr at 1
utility):
.Pp
.Dl (sleep 1800; sh command_file >& errors)&
.Pp
To repetitively run a command (with
.Xr csh 1 ) :
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
while (! -r zzz.rawdata)
	sleep 300
end
foreach i (*.rawdata)
	sleep 70
	awk -f collapse_data $i >> results
end
.Ed
.Pp
The scenario for such a script might be: a program currently
running is taking longer than expected to process a series of
files, and it would be nice to have another program start
processing the files created by the first program as soon as it is finished
(when
.Pa zzz.rawdata
is created).
The script checks every five minutes for this file.
When it is found, processing is done in several steps
by sleeping 70 seconds between each
.Xr awk 1
job.
.Pp
To monitor the growth of a file without consuming too many resources:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
while true; do
	ls -l file
	sleep 5
done
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width flag -compact
.It Li \&0
On successful completion, or if the signal
.Dv SIGALRM
was received.
.It Li \&>\&0
An error occurred.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr at 1 ,
.Xr nanosleep 2 ,
.Xr setitimer 2 ,
.Xr alarm 3 ,
.Xr sleep 3 ,
.Xr usleep 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
command offers a superset of
.St -p1003.2
functionality.
The handling of fractional arguments is provided as an extension to the
specification.
