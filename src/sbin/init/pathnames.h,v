@• kernel: merge rnd_flush() declarations into <randimpl.h>
• randomioctl: let RNDSTIRARC4 invoke rnd_flush() if called from init(8)
• init, reboot/halt: use unified "pathnames.h"
• init: use RNDSTIRARC4 to reset all pools (lopool, arc4random) on halt
• init: write 2048 bytes to /var/db/host.random to make it an even 8 KiB
• init: redesign code for that, minimise sleep calls, tested with tempo-
  rary printf/warning/etc. calls in userspace and kernel
• init: upon SIGTSTP, invoke RNDSTIRARC4 to help halt/reboot
• halt/reboot: do similar things like init wrt. signals, output, seed file
