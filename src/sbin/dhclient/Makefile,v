log
@• move all the formerly statically linked binaries to /usr/d{,s}bin/ and
  link them dynamically, except…
  ‣ init(8) since it’s used for system startup (chflags(8) comes to mind)
  ‣ shutdown(8) since it’s 4550 root:operator, which would be hard to do
    in a non-exploitable way otherwise
  ‣ test(1), domainname(1), dhclient-script, since they are shell scripts
  ‣ ldconfig(8) to prevent shooting into ourselves’ feet
• add the build of two crunchgen(1)d binaries, dbins and dbinsuid, collec-
  ting the stuff formerly statically built (dbins is 0555 root:bin, while
  dbinsuid is 4555 root:bin – {ping,traceroute}{,6} only)
• some cosmetical et al. changes to the Makefiles involved
  ‣ spacing, shell
  ‣ utf-8
  ‣ use ${CONFGRP}
• CFLAGS+=-DNFS -I… → CPPFLAGS+=… *sigh*

This enables us to make most out of ports/sysutils/fakeroot
