.Sh NAME
.Nm quotacheck
.Nd filesystem quota consistency checker
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm quotacheck
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl g
.Op Fl u
.Op Fl v
.Ar filesystem Op Ar ...
.Nm quotacheck
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl g
.Op Fl l Ar maxparallel

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
examines each filesystem,
builds a table of current disk usage,
and compares this table against that recorded
in the disk quota file for the filesystem.
If any inconsistencies are detected, both the
quota file and the current system copy of the
incorrect quotas are updated (the latter only
occurs if an active filesystem is checked).
By default, both user and group quotas are checked.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
If the
.Fl a
flag is supplied in place of any filesystem names,
.Nm
will check all the filesystems indicated in
.Pa /etc/fstab
to be read-write with disk quotas.
By default, only the types of quotas listed in
.Pa /etc/fstab
are checked.
.It Fl d
Enable debugging mode.
No actual data will be written on disk(s).
.It Fl g
Only group quotas listed in
.Pa /etc/fstab
are to be checked.
.It Fl l Ar maxparallel
Limit the number of parallel checks to the number
.Ar maxparallel
specified in the argument (see
.Xr fsck 8 ) .
.It Fl u
Only user quotas listed in
.Pa /etc/fstab
are to be checked.
.It Fl v
.Nm
reports discrepancies between the
calculated and recorded disk quotas.
.El
.Pp
Specifying both
.Fl g
and
.Fl u
is equivalent to the default.
Parallel passes are run on the filesystems required,
using the pass numbers in
.Pa /etc/fstab
in an identical fashion to
.Xr fsck 8 .
.Pp
Normally
.Nm
operates silently.
.Pp
.Nm
expects each filesystem to be checked to have
quota files named
.Pa quota.user
and
.Pa quota.group
located at the root of the associated filesystem.
These defaults may be overridden in
.Pa /etc/fstab .
If a file is not present,
.Nm
will create it.
.Pp
.Nm
is normally run at boot time from the
.Pa /etc/rc
file
.Pq see Xr rc 8
before enabling disk quotas with
.Xr quotaon 8 .
.Pp
.Nm
accesses the raw device in calculating the actual
disk usage for each user.
Thus, the filesystems
checked should be quiescent while
.Nm
is running.
