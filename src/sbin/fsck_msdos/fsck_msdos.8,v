.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm fsck_msdos
.Nd DOS/Windows (FAT) filesystem consistency checker
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm fsck_msdos
.Op Fl fpny
.Ar filesystem ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility verifies and repairs
.Tn FAT
filesystems (more commonly known as
.Tn DOS
filesystems).
It checks the specified filesystems and tries to repair all
detected inconsistencies, requesting confirmation before
making any changes.
.Pp
If the
.Fl p
flag is given,
.Nm
preens the specified filesystems.
It is normally started this way by
.Xr fsck 8
run from
.Xr rc 8
during automatic reboot, when a FAT filesystem is detected.
When preening filesystems,
.Nm
will fix common inconsistencies non-interactively.
If more serious problems are found,
.Nm
does not try to fix them, indicates that it was not
successful, and exits.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
This option is ignored by
.Nm fsck_msdos ,
and is present only for compatibility with programs that
check other filesystem types for consistency, such as
.Xr fsck_ffs 8 .
.It Fl n
Assume a
.Dq no
response to all questions asked by
.Nm
except for
.Dq CONTINUE? ,
which is assumed to be affirmative.
Filesystems will not be opened for writing.
This is the default for filesystems to be checked that are
concurrently mounted writable.
.It Fl p
Preen the specified filesystems.
.It Fl y
Causes
.Nm
to assume
.Dq yes
as the answer to all operator questions.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fs 5 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr fsck 8 ,
.Xr fsck_ffs 8 ,
.Xr mount_msdos 8 ,
.Xr newfs_msdos 8 ,
.Xr rc 8
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
is still under construction.
