.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is used to send commands to a SCSI device.
It is also a sample usage of the user-level SCSI commands.
.Ar out_fmt
can be
.Ql -
to read output data from stdin;
.Ar in_fmt
can be
.Ql -
to write input data to stdout.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar device
Specifies the
.Ar device
that should be opened, i.e.,
.Pa /dev/rsd0c .
.It Fl d Ar debug_level
Sets the SCSI kernel debug level.
The kernel must have been compiled with the
.Cm SCSIDEBUG
option.
See
.Pa /sys/scsi/scsi_debug.h
to figure out what to set the kernel debug level to.
.Pp
.It Fl z Ar seconds
Freezes all activity on all SCSI busses for a given number of
seconds.
If
.Fl v
is also specified, a BEL character is sent to the standard
output at the start and finish of the bus freeze.
This requires that the kernel be built with the SCSI_FREEZE kernel option.
This kernel code is not committed yet.
.Pp
.It Fl m Ar page
Read a device mode page.
The file
.Pa /usr/share/misc/scsi_modes
is read to discover how to interpret the mode data.
The environment variable
.Ev SCSI_MODES
can specify a different file to use.
.Pp
.It Fl P Ar pc
Specify a page control field.
The page control fields are
.Bd -literal -offset
0 Current Values
1 Changeable Values
2 Default Values
3 Saved Values
.Ed
.Pp
.It Fl e
Permits you to edit the fields.
It will use the editor specified by your
.Ev EDITOR
environment variable.
To store changes permanently, edit page control 3 using the
.Fl P
flag.
.Pp
.It Fl p
Can be used against the "super scsi" device
.Pa /dev/scsi/super
to probe all devices with a given SCSI
.Ar lun
on a given SCSI bus.
The
.Ar bus
can be selected with the
.Fl b
option and the default is 0.
The
.Ar lun
can be selected with the
.Fl l
option and the default is 0.
See
.Xr scsi 4
for a description of the "super scsi" device.
.Pp
.It Fl r
Can be used in
.Fx 1.1
to reprobe a specific SCSI device at a given
Bus, Target and Lun.
This is not needed in
.Fx 2.1 ,
since opening a fixed SCSI device
has the side effect of reprobing it, and probing with the bus with the
.Fl p
option should bring on line any newly found devices.
See
.Xr scsi 4
for a description of fixed SCSI devices.
.Pp
.It Fl c
Permits you to send user-level SCSI commands specified on
the command line to a
device.
The command is sent using the
.Dv SCIOCCOMMAND
ioctl, so the device you are accessing must permit this ioctl.
See
.Xr scsi 4
for full details of which minor devices permit the ioctl, and
.Xr scsi 3
for the full details on how to build up the commands and data phases
using the format arguments.
.Pp
.It Fl v
Turns on more verbose information.
.Pp
.It Fl s Ar seconds
Sets the command timeout to
.Ar seconds .
The default is two seconds.
.Pp
.It Fl c Ar cmd_fmt
Specifies the command as described in
.Xr scsi 3 .
The additional arguments provide values for any variables
specified in the command format.
.Pp
.It Fl o Ar count out_fmt arg ...
Indicates that this is a data out command (i.e., data will be sent from
the system to the device) with
.Ar count
bytes of data.
The data out is built up using the facilities described in
.Xr scsi 3
using the provided arguments to fill in any integer variables.
.Ar out_fmt
can be specified as a hyphen
.Pq Ql -
to indicate that
.Ar count
bytes of data should be read from the standard input.
.Pp
.It Fl i Ar count in_fmt arg ...
Indicates that this is a data in command (i.e., data will be read from
the device into the system) with
.Ar count
bytes of data read in.
The information is extracted according to
.Ar in_fmt
using the facilities described in
.Xr scsi 3
and displayed on the standard output.
.Ar in_fmt
can be specified as a hyphen
.Pq Ql -
to indicate that
.Ar count
bytes of data input should be written to the standard output.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Ev SU_DEBUG_OUTPUT
variable can be set to a file to send debugging
output to that file.
.Pp
The
.Ev SU_DEBUG_LEVEL
variable can be set to a non-zero integer to increase
the level of debugging.
Currently this is an on or off thing; it should
perhaps use the ioctl to set the debug level in the kernel and then set
it back to zero at program exit.
.Pp
The
.Ev SU_DEBUG_TRUNCATE
variable can be set to an integer to limit the
amount of data phase output sent to the debugging file.
.Pp
The
.Ev EDITOR
variable determines the editor to use for the mode editor.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To verify that the device type for the disk
.Pa /dev/rsd0c
is 0
(direct access device):
.Bd -literal -offset
# scsi -f /dev/rsd0c -c "12 0 0 0 64 0" -i 64 "*b3 b5"
0
.Ed
.Pp
To do an inquiry to
.Pa /dev/rsd2c :
.Bd -literal -offset
# scsi -f /dev/rsd2c -c "12 0 0 0 64 0" -i 64 "s8 z8 z16 z4"
FUJITSU M2654S-512 010P
.Ed
.Pp
To edit mode page 1 on
.Pa /dev/rsd2c
and store it permanently on the
drive (set AWRE and ARRE to 1 to enable bad block remapping):
.Bd -literal -offset
# scsi -f /dev/rsd2c -m 1 -e -P 3
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr scsi 3 ,
.Xr scsi 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in 386BSD 0.1.2.4/FreeBSD to support the new reprobe
and user SCSI commands.
.Sh BUGS
Some devices respond to an inquiry for all LUNS.
This will cause them
to come on line to 8 times during reprobe to different logical units.
"scsi -f /dev/rsd0c -c "4 0 0 0 0 0" permits anyone who can write to
.Pa /dev/rsd0c
to format the disk drive.

.Ss SCSI commands
The command arguments to the
.Fl cio
options specify the command data buffer used to both send and receive
information to and from the
.Xr scsi 4
subsystem.
Their format is:
d207 20
a226 1
.Dl Fl c Ar command Op Ar argument ...
d228 16
a243 94
The commands are composed of a list of field specifiers.
The specifiers denote the field name, the field value, and the length of
the field.
Examples are given below.
.Pp
Whitespace and text following a
.Sq #
character in the command string are ignored.
.Pp
The first part of a field specifier is the field name and is surrounded
by curly braces
.Pq Sq {} .
This part is optional and may be left out.
.Pp
The second part is the value of the field.
The value may be given directly or may arrange that the next argument to
the
.Nm
command be used as the value of the field.
Direct hexadecimal
.Pq Li 0\-FF
or decimal
.Pq 0\-255
values may be specified.
The special value
.Ic v
can be used to arrange that the next integer argument be taken from the
.Ar argument
list.
For retrieving output (with
.Fl i ) ,
this part of the field cannot be used.
.Pp
The third part specifies the length of the field.
This is optional and defaults to one byte if not specified.
The length may be specified in bits by prefixing it with
.Ic b
or
.Ic t ,
or in bytes by prefixing it with
.Ic i .
Additionally, character arrays can be specified by prefixing with
.Ic c
or, with zeroed trailing spaces, with
.Ic z .
Bits are packed together tightly and begin with the high bit.
New bytes are started when a byte fills or an
.Ic i
field is next.
.Ic i
fields indicate a 1\-4 byte integral value that must already be given in
SCSI byte order (most significant byte first).
Otherwise, the field value specified will be swapped into SCSI byte order.
.Pp
Retrieving data (with
.Fl i )
follows similarly but without field values.
Besides field specifiers, the command can also include control operations,
which currently includes seeking operations used to ignore returned data.
Seek operations are composed of the
.Ic s
character followed by the absolute position to skip to.
If the position is prefixed with a
.Ic + ,
the position is interpreted relative to the current position.
.\" The position can also be read from the
.\" .Ar arg
.\" list if
.\" .Ic v
.\" is specified as the seek value.
.Pp
Entire fields can be suppressed from being returned with the
.Ic *
modifier prepended to the field width.
.Pp
Here are some examples:
.Bl -tag -width 17n
.It Ic s8 z8 z16 z4
Seek to position 8 and specify three fields of lengths 8 bytes, 16
bytes, and 4 bytes.
.It Ic 1A 2
Specify a one-byte field with the hexadecimal value
.Li 0x1A
followed by another one-byte field with the decimal value 2.
.It Ic v:i1
Specify a one-byte field whose value will be determined from the
next argument in the
.Ar argument
list.
.It Ic 0:7
Specify a 7-bit field with a value of zero.
.It Ic *b3 b5
Specify a three-bit field that will be suppressed from being returned
and a five-bit field that will be returned.
