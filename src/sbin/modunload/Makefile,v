@module load/unload utilities cleanup spree:
* add MirOS RCS IDs
* make __CRAZY=Yes clean
* fix ELF/a.out detection
* remove duplicate file
* rewrite Makefile
* honour ELF vs a.out issue in "_%s" printing of symbol names
* allow modules to be named <foo>.ko as well
* use .Sq in manual page instead of by-hand quoting
* use <stdbool.h> instead of rolling our own
