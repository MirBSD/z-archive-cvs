@build infrastructure for updated vnconfig(8) and new vnkeygen(8), not
connected to the build yet

new vnconfig(8) will have additional openbsd mount_vnd(8) functionality
as well as old mirbsd vnconfig(8) functionality, but no keyfile handling
other than load and pass to kernel, and be included in /sbin and dynamic

new vnkeygen(8) will take over the rule of PKCS#5 PBKDF2 processing (by
converting these to key files), as well as key file generation/handling,
and be included in /usr/sbin
