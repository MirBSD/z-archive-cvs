This document reflects the use of

with the 4.2BSD and 4.3BSD filesystem organization.  This
is a revision of the
original paper written by
T. J. Kowalski.
.PP
Filesystem Check Program (\fIfsck_ffs\fR)
is an interactive filesystem check and repair program.
.I Fsck_ffs
uses the redundant structural information in the
UNIX filesystem to perform several consistency checks.
If an inconsistency is detected, it is reported
to the operator, who may elect to fix or ignore
each inconsistency.
These inconsistencies result from the permanent interruption
of the filesystem updates, which are performed every
time a file is modified.
Unless there has been a hardware failure,
.I fsck_ffs
is able to repair corrupted filesystems
using procedures based upon the order in which UNIX honors
these filesystem update requests.
.PP
The purpose of this document is to describe the normal updating
of the filesystem,
to discuss the possible causes of filesystem corruption,
and to present the corrective actions implemented
by
.I fsck_ffs.
Both the program and the interaction between the
program and the operator are described.
