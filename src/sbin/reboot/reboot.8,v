.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm reboot ,
.Nm halt
.Nd stopping and restarting the system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm halt
.Op Fl dnpq
.Nm reboot
.Op Fl dnq
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm halt
and
.Nm reboot
utilities flush the filesystem cache to disk, run the system
shutdown script, send all running processes a
.Dv SIGHUP ,
.Dv SIGTERM
and one or more
.Dv SIGKILL ,
and, respectively, halt or restart the system.
The action is logged, including entering a shutdown record into the login
accounting file.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Causes system to create a dump before rebooting.
This option is useful for debugging system dump procedures or
capturing the state of a corrupted or misbehaving system.
See
.Xr savecore 8
for information on how to recover this dump.
.It Fl n
Prevent filesystem cache from being flushed.
This option should probably not be used.
.It Fl p
Causes the system to power down, if it is being halted, and the
hardware supports automatic power down.
.It Fl q
Quick.
The system is halted or restarted quickly and ungracefully, and only
the flushing of the filesystem cache is performed.
This option should probably not be used.
.El
.Pp
Normally, the
.Xr shutdown 8
utility is used when the system needs to be halted or restarted, giving
users advance warning of their impending doom.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/db/host.random -compact
.It Pa /etc/rc.shutdown
script which is run at shutdown time by
.Pa /etc/rc
.It Pa /var/db/host.random
where 2 KiB entropy are stored before
.Xr reboot 2

@• kernel: merge rnd_flush() declarations into <randimpl.h>
• randomioctl: let RNDSTIRARC4 invoke rnd_flush() if called from init(8)
• init, reboot/halt: use unified "pathnames.h"
• init: use RNDSTIRARC4 to reset all pools (lopool, arc4random) on halt
• init: write 2048 bytes to /var/db/host.random to make it an even 8 KiB
• init: redesign code for that, minimise sleep calls, tested with tempo-
  rary printf/warning/etc. calls in userspace and kernel
• init: upon SIGTSTP, invoke RNDSTIRARC4 to help halt/reboot
• halt/reboot: do similar things like init wrt. signals, output, seed file
