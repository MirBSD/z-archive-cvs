.Nd mount an ext2fs filesystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_ext2fs
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Ar special
.Ar node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command attaches an ext2fs filesystem
.Ar special
device on to the filesystem tree at the point
.Ar node .
This command is invoked by
.Xr mount 8
when using the syntax
.Bd -ragged -offset 4n
.Nm mount Op options
-t ext2fs
.Ar special Ar node
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ar special
device must correspond to a partition registered in the
.Xr disklabel 5 .
.Pp
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o Ar options
Options are specified with a
.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
See the
.Xr mount 8

.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr disklabel 5 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
.Xr mount 8 ,
.Xr umount 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
function first appeared in
.Fx 2.2 .
Starting with
.Mx 8 ,
asynchronous mounts are supported.
.Sh BUGS
Support for the ext2fs filesystem was broken in
.Mx 8 ,
.Mx 9
and
.Mx 10 .

.Sh CAVEATS
Use of the ext2fs code is discoraged due to the
.Sx bugs ;
.Nm
currently mounts filesystems read-only by default as a consequence.
d94 5
a98 8
Support for the ext2fs filesystem in all its variations currently
is buggy.
Symbolic links cannot be created or modified since
.Mx 8
for the penalty of a kernel panic.
Inode sizes other than 128 are not supported; some
.Mx \#10-current
snapshots supported only inode sizes of 256.
