@first steps toward a new time API
• no DJB code (actual code) any more, only reimplementation of algorithms
  whose code is placed in USA PD
• no struct returns any more
• skip the extra tai_t step
• no _t suffix for types I define
• try to be a bit more elegant – I learned a lot since then, after all

the old ABI is still provided until we bump libc major
‣ the new API might wander off libc into libmbfun then, _too_

goal is functional equivalence (after all, it’s been proven correct)

@more migration

(in case you wonder: goal is to make libc, kernel and bootloaders share
the code currently in libkern, (some of) libsa, and libz, and to move
the bootloaders out of src/sys/ and into some more sane place)
