/*
 * The game port can manage 4 buttons and 4 variable resistors (usually 2
 * joysticks, each with 2 buttons and 2 pots.) via the port at address 0x201.
 * Getting the state of the buttons is done by reading the game port;
 * buttons 1-4 correspond to bits 4-7 and resistors 1-4 (X1, Y1, X2, Y2)
 * to bits 0-3.  If button 1 (resp 2, 3, 4) is pressed, the bit 4 (resp 5,
 * 6, 7) is set to 0 to get the value of a resistor, write the value 0xff
 * at port and wait until the corresponding bit returns to 0.
