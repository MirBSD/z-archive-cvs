@• do not always srandom(), once is enough, it’s not supposed to be crypto-
  graphically good anyway, just continuous
• new int arc4random_seedfreq; contains the frequency of arc4random(9)
  re-seeds, by default still 10 minutes
• if a VIA C3 Hardware RNG is found, re-seed every minute (ok 64 seconds…)
• bump © years, sync licence etc.

@big fat licence update (I left some which are bsiegert@@'s alone though)
also, remove licence boilerplate from some .h files who don't deserve it
and remove and add some advertising clauses because I say so

 * Here is a very good random number generator.  This implementation is

 * Number Generator'', David G. Carta, Communications of the ACM, Jan 1990,
 * Vol 33 No 1.  Do NOT modify this code unless you have a very thorough

 * Here is easier-to-decipher pseudocode:
 *
 * p = (16807*seed)<30:0>	# e.g., the low 31 bits of the product
 * q = (16807*seed)<62:31>	# e.g., the high 31 bits starting at bit 32
 * if (p + q < 2^31)
 * 	seed = p + q
 * else
 *	seed = ((p + q) & (2^31 - 1)) + 1
 * return (seed);
 *
 * The result is in (0,2^31), e.g., it's always positive.
