@Hacked in the train to Zwitserland:

• new: memcpy()=bcopy()=memmove()
• new macro: __strong_alias (incidentally, TNF has exactly the same name
  and exactly (except an ‘a’ more) the same implementation)
• use __strong_alias and #ifdef lint instead of duplicate code via unifdef
  abuse
• sprinkle a few uses of _ALIGN_TEXT
• remove duplicate memmove, memcpy, bcopy and ovbcopy implementations
  from the i386 kernel
• _ALIGN_TEXT is a nop #ifdef SMALL
• remove more duplicate definitions, etc.
• remove more dead code from bootloader -D_TEST
