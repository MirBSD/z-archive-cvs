@• kern: new KERNISUSR (defined by libc and libmdsup, but not by either
  bootloader or kernel), enables new NUSRCS, UIF_NUSRCS
• move MD strncmp() to kern
• move MI {str,wcs}case{,n}cmp to kern
• make wcs* functions NU not KU as we don’t need them in the kernel YET
• move __main to NU (it’s a joke anyway, I think)
• bootloader: make devsw_prefix_match case-insensitive

@sync with libc

attention: possible regressions:
* everything with RCS IDs, SCCS IDs, ident, indentation, weak aliases,
  and the .gnu.warning.* stuff
* these:
  - sys/lib/libkern/qdivrem.c
  - sys/lib/libkern/strcat.c
  - sys/lib/libkern/strcpy.c
* especially these:
  - sys/lib/libkern/arch/i386/SYS.h
  - sys/lib/libkern/arch/sparc/SYS.h
* I reverted these and did NOT commit the change, because they
  look bogus to me:
  - sys/lib/libkern/arch/sparc/_setjmp.S
  - sys/lib/libkern/arch/sparc/divrem.m4

Also, __P() and so on were introduced e.g. in strcat(), and IMHO,
this code needs more work in libc as well.
