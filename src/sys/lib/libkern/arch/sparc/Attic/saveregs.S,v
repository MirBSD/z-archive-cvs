@sync with libc

attention: possible regressions:
* everything with RCS IDs, SCCS IDs, ident, indentation, weak aliases,
  and the .gnu.warning.* stuff
* these:
  - sys/lib/libkern/qdivrem.c
  - sys/lib/libkern/strcat.c
  - sys/lib/libkern/strcpy.c
* especially these:
  - sys/lib/libkern/arch/i386/SYS.h
  - sys/lib/libkern/arch/sparc/SYS.h
* I reverted these and did NOT commit the change, because they
  look bogus to me:
  - sys/lib/libkern/arch/sparc/_setjmp.S
  - sys/lib/libkern/arch/sparc/divrem.m4

Also, __P() and so on were introduced e.g. in strcat(), and IMHO,
this code needs more work in libc as well.
