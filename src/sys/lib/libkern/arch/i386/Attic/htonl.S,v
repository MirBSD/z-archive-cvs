log
@proof-of-concept implementation of a few functions for the
new "kern" directory containing stuff shared between
* userland (-fhosted -lgcc)
* kernel (-ffreestanding -D_KERNEL -nostdlib)
* bootloader (-ffreestanding -D_STANDALONE -nostdlib)

Here, userland and kernel share some functions not for the
bootloader (e.g. utf-8 stuff), while kernel and bootloader
share a few libgcc replacement functions.

I took the htonl() &c. functions because they were pretty
easy to implement; no sparc assembly version because it's
a 'no-op' and I trust gcc so much as to produce optimised
output for the type foo(type x) { return (x); } case.

Not tested.

Most of the functions will be written "on demand" and re-
written from scratch by me.

@sync with libc

attention: possible regressions:
* everything with RCS IDs, SCCS IDs, ident, indentation, weak aliases,
  and the .gnu.warning.* stuff
* these:
  - sys/lib/libkern/qdivrem.c
  - sys/lib/libkern/strcat.c
  - sys/lib/libkern/strcpy.c
* especially these:
  - sys/lib/libkern/arch/i386/SYS.h
  - sys/lib/libkern/arch/sparc/SYS.h
* I reverted these and did NOT commit the change, because they
  look bogus to me:
  - sys/lib/libkern/arch/sparc/_setjmp.S
  - sys/lib/libkern/arch/sparc/divrem.m4

Also, __P() and so on were introduced e.g. in strcat(), and IMHO,
this code needs more work in libc as well.

@big fat licence update (I left some which are bsiegert@@'s alone though)
also, remove licence boilerplate from some .h files who don't deserve it
and remove and add some advertising clauses because I say so
