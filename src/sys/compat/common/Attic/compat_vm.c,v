@Revert Changeset #35c04355627135d7 - once again, no COMPAT_78 any more
(we don't need it in -current; people who need it should use -stable),
basically, 7K savings but slightly less confusing code

Also removes the compat option from syscalls.conf

@Cluefully revert changeset #222542ef55eafb75 allowing a kernel built
to be executed on systems with various degrees of #7-current and old
#8-beta again (as on thor), with few or no failures.

Still containing COMPAT_78 option is kern/syscalls.conf (compatopts)
besides files touched by this commit.

log
@strip some obsolete COMPAT_* options for OpenBSD 2.5 and
some older MirOS #7-current snapshot compatibility

This shouldn't affect running OpenBSD 3.x or MirOS #7 binaries.

Also, clean up some comments.
