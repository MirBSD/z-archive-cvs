1.3
log
@replace in-kernel zlib 0.95 with user-space libz 1.2.3
- crypto/deflate.c is now called crypto/kdeflate.c (basename conflict)
- I should probably better have made a libzkrnl.a
- ppp-deflate is disabled for now, until stuff goes in upstream
  (have to check for breakage in unrelated stuff, like rsync)
- untested, but kernel gets build

@* merge src/sys/
  (at least the better part of it)
* revert IPv6 networking to OpenBSD, since
  I didn't get IPV4_MAPPED addresses working :(
