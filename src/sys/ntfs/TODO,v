- convert the code to do caching in buffer cache indexed by
  file-vnode/file-offset so that NTFS would take advantage of UBC;
  it should also improve performance somewhat, because if it's necessary
  to find some offset in a file, it's possible to check if the data
  are available in the cache before doing the bmap operation first
	(from Chuq)

- working VOP_BALLOC() (new in UBC)
	(from Chuq)

- readdir: evalutate impact of using variable length reclen - should
  enable us to store much more entries into buf in typical case with
  short filenames, though more work would need to be done in offset != 0
  case

- readdir: fill in proper "inode" number for '..' entry

- handle Unicode filenames more inteligently - they are translated to UTF-2
  form currently, adding hooks for various character sets or other encodings
  would be trivial

- implement writing into resident attributes, so it would be possible
   to write into "small" files (<30KB) too
	(from Semen Ustimenko <semenu@@FreeBSD.org>)
  generally, better write support


- support mount update

- really implement sync

- write necessary bits to support NTFS in libsa

- basic sysinst support for NTFS

- NTFS ACL support (though usefullness of such feature is arguable)
