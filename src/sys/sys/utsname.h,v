@• libedit, libm, libocurses, libsectok, libskey, libssl, libusbhid, libutil:
  do something I should've long done and bump their majors – ABI changes are
  not only removals (or changes) of T/D symbols but also additions(!) of U
  symbols (i.e. imports); these changed during the <ctype.h> changes from a
  while ago and depend on newer libc; I did an nm(1) comparision against #9
  (release) to allow upgrading by source
• libc, uname: since I'm bumping a lot of other shlibs, it's a good time to
  bump the libc major as well and finally get rid of that struct utsname bug
  I introduced when I had no idea what I was doing, in MirOS #1 or so…
• libpthread: requires a major bump if libc major is bumped, or so they say
• bump os patchlevel

agreed bsiegert@@
XXX any more changes to do before release?

@d'oh, this was obviously stupid. new libc with old apps was safe, but new
apps allocated only 1280 bytes for a struct utsname on the stack, trigge-
ring propolice in make(1) at end of main() because of an off-by-one over-
write. until we bump libc major, increase struct utsname size by one byte
again.

@okay, time to clear up one of the earliest messes in MirBSD's history…
(yes I was young and stup^Wunknowingly did this)

• lib/libc/gen/uname.c: do not fill in the struct utsname.patchlevel
  field any more.
• X11/xc/config/imake/imake.c: use sysctl kern.ospatchlevel, instead
  of relying on non-standard/unsafe struct utsname.patchlevel.
• lib/libc/gen/uname.c: in order to avoid a libc version bump, bzero
  the struct utsname * argument, so that the former patchlevel field
  becomes a NUL string.
• sys/sys/utsname.h: revert, i.e. delete the “patchlevel” field from
  struct utsname. Do NOT bump the os patchlevel, because this change
  does not affect the kernel/userland interface – that field has ne-
  ver been used in kernel land. This change, back then, was not safe
  as per ABI policy.
• lib/libc/gen/uname.c, share/mk/sys.mk, sys/sys/param.h: patchlevel
  bump for size change of struct utsname, used in gen/uname.c to add
  1 to the number of octets to bzero(), ifdef'd (so that new source,
  old includes, is safe).
• lib/libc/Makefile: mention gen/uname.c change for next major bump.

All other users of struct utsname in the base system have been taken
care of already (most notably uname(1); the others didn't use the os
patchlevel anyway).

@* merge src/sys/
  (at least the better part of it)
* revert IPv6 networking to OpenBSD, since
  I didn't get IPV4_MAPPED addresses working :(
