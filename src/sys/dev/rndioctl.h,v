log
@new ioctl RNDADDRNDNESS which works kinda like Linux’ RNDADDENTROPY
in that it doesn’t separate the entropy-to-kernel transfer between
write and ioctl, but it has, like all ioctls, a fixed argument size
and can (new!) take a source, e.g. RND_SRC_MOUSE¹, argument inside
struct rnd_add_randomness.source (int). currently limited to 16 32-bit
words (64 bytes), but as ekeyd, for which this interface is intended,
writes only 32 bytes at a time it seems fine to me.

① tested with mircvs://contrib/hosted/tg/e2k.c modified slightly

@* merge src/sys/

* revert IPv6 networking to OpenBSD, since
  I didn't get IPV4_MAPPED addresses working :(
