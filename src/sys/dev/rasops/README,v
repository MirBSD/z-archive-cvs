This directory contains `rasops', a set of raster operations intended to
replace the dev/rcons/raster stuff for both wscons and rcons. It yields
significantly improved performance, supports multiple depths and color.

Issues/TODO:

- There is no generic `putchar' function for 2bpp
- Color handling for 2bpp is broken
- copycols() from rasops_bitops.h is broken in right->left case
- The stamp mutex is not particularly safe
- 64-bit types are not used on machines that are 64-bit
- We should never be doing reads/writes of less than 32-bits
- Flags in attribute values are hardcoded
- Need a manpage
- Should handle multiple fonts simulatneously
- Generate an `empty' box character when we have no match?
- Use 'int' in lieu of 'int32' where we can
- Compress some cases in rasops1.c
