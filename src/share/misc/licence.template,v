INSTRUCTIONS:
To apply the template[1] specify the years of copyright (separated by
comma, not as a range), the legal names of the copyright holders, and
the real names of the authors (and licensors, possibly) if different.
Avoid adding any text that could be read as further restriction.

RATIONALE:
This licence is apt for any kind of work (such as source code, fonts,
documentation, graphics, sound etc.) and the preferred terms for work
added to MirBSD. It has been drafted as universally usable equivalent
of the "historic permission notice"[2] adapted to Europen law because
some countries have specific requirements for disclaimers, and author
and licensor can differ in (droit d'auteur) legislations. The licence
conforms to DFSG[3] 1.1, OKD[4] 2.1, OSD[5] 1.9, CSD[6], qualifies as
a Free Software[7] and Free Documentation[8] licence, for Free Cultu-
ral Works[9], and is thus included in relevant lists[10] of licences.
It's also a licence suitable for OER and Open Content[18].

The webpage[19] for this licence contains further information as well
as additional resources such as translations.

@A british lawyer (although totally computer-illiterate) suggested
to rather use the word "defect" here, which strikes me as fitting.

This is still difficult. I read this as:
- bugs in upstream are not "a direct error"
- "even if advised of the...existence of a defect" means that, if
  they issue a security advisory, I still can choose to not upda-
  te (e.g. to not break more stuff)
- unknown mistakes are not "advised"
- if an unknown mistake does not prevent any "intended use of the
  work" (testing!) we're out of the wood as well
- documented mistakes shift the moving target "intended use"

Comments? This is still a draft.
