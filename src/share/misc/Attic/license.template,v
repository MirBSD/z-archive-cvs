$OpenBSD: license.template,v 1.2 2003/06/03 22:37:00 david Exp $

This is a template of a modified* ISC licence, which the OpenBSD project
recommends for use by new code. The MirOS Project, however, recommends a
different licence, which can be seen at /usr/share/misc/licence.template
or http://mirbsd.de/MirOS-Licence if you have www access. This (ISC) li-
cence template has been placed at http://mirbsd.de/ISC-Licence as well.

*) The modification addresses a problem with the original template which
   allowed derivate works to strip the disclaimer. It is, however, safer
   to use the MirOS Licence Template (see above) anyway.
*) The second modification clarifies the word "and" in the first senten-
   ce into the "and/or" form by request of the Free Software Foundation.


It is important to specify the year of the copyright.  Additional years
should be separated by a comma, e.g.
    Copyright (c) 2003, 2004

If you add extra text to the body of the license, be careful not to
add further restrictions.

Note: Some older versions of this licence template were missing the text
"this permission notice" and used "and" instead of "and/or". This is not
recommended, see above.

@• licence.template: let it look less like a big monolith, put emphasis on
  the licence's shortness (kind of like with the ISC licence)
• license.template: put back a slightly modified (to address the issues
  pointed out by various people) version, since the MirOS website is still
  the primary resource on the ISC licence template for the ifrOSS Lizenz-
  zentrum (and maybe referenced by others); point out that our template is
  superiour (especially for authors in droit d'auteur legislations) though

Below is an example license to be used for new code in OpenBSD,
modeled after the ISC license.

The MirOS Project however recommends a different licence template, look at
/usr/share/misc/licence.template or http://mirbsd.de/MirOS-Licence for details.

IMPORTANT: It has been suggested to change the last part to read:
[...] notice, this permission notice and the disclaimer appear in [...]
The MirOS Project seconds this motion if you must use the ISC/OpenBSD
licence instead of the MirOS licence (see licence.template for that).
