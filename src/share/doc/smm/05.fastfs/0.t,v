This work was done under grants from
the National Science Foundation under grant MCS80-05144,
and the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DoD) under
ARPA Order No. 4031 monitored by Naval Electronic System Command under
Contract No. N00039-82-C-0235.

A reimplementation of the UNIX filesystem is described.
The reimplementation provides substantially higher throughput
rates by using more flexible allocation policies
that allow better locality of reference and can
be adapted to a wide range of peripheral and processor characteristics.
The new filesystem clusters data that is sequentially accessed
and provides two block sizes to allow fast access to large files
while not wasting large amounts of space for small files.
File access rates of up to ten times faster than the traditional
UNIX filesystem are experienced.
Long needed enhancements to the programmers'
interface are discussed.
These include a mechanism to place advisory locks on files, 
extensions of the name space across filesystems,
the ability to use long file names,
and provisions for administrative control of resource usage.
