@The MirPorts Framework is now free of advertising clauses.
This is, of course, still using our defined barriers between
the framework and the software installed through the frame-
work, dear RMS, please look more carefully at this next time.

@Finish working on the advertising clause collection (well, some people
collect stickers, other people collect licence terms...) and add a list
of these included in MirPorts (not much yet).

This is supposedly the last commit before the release, which is dedicated
to the spirits of our ancestors which are floating around freely in this
longest night of the year.
