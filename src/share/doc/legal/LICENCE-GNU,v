Special rules for GNU and similar less free software
====================================================

Non-GNU software
----------------

Some software comes under GPL (lynx, mkisofs, perl) or
different licences (sendmail, perl). For GPL software,
the "Obtaining source code" section below applies. For
sendmail, it applies similarily.

GNU software
------------

Some software comes under GPL with documentation under
either GPL or GFDL, and requires copyright assignment,
namely: autotools, binutils, cvs, gcc, rcs, texinfo

The section "Obtaining source code" below applies. The
GNU software parts are however not covered by the col-
lective copyright on MirOS asserted by the founder. We
also ask any contributor to this part of the source to
assign back the US style copyright to the FSF. Europe-
an droit d'auteur rights are retained.


GNU FDL
-------

The MirOS project goals forbid distributing code - this does
not exclude documentation - which we cannot modify.

The GNU Free Documentation License has been deemed non-free,
unless neither cover texts nor invariant sections are speci-
fied - this is, however, not the case with the documents in-
cluded, thus we have decided to delete them.

Update: even in the case neither front nor back cover texts,
nor invariant sections are specified, the GFDL is considered
non-free: http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html

cf. http://people.debian.org/%7Esrivasta/Position_Statement.xhtml

If you don't like the fact, contact your local FSF represen-
tative, or the FSF Europe or USA.

Compromise
----------

Currently, we are delivering GNU software bundled with MirOS
and, for a few key components (gcc and binutils), do not ex-
clude documentation (for others, we either base our documen-
tation on an older non-GFDL version (this worked for cvs) or
do not install it, e.g. texinfo). RMS has assured we can re-
distribute the GFDL-licenced parts in our CVS repository and
on CDs, via SSH, in a non-world-readable or encrypted direc-
tory, according to http://marc.info/?m=113699292525210

All copyright on the changes is assigned back to the FSF, so
there is not much we can do about it. In order to fulfil the
licence's requirements, there is always the original version
available at the CVSweb of "sources.redhat.com", and the mo-
dified and original versions are visible via MirOS CVSweb as
shown below.

We urge people to not licence their work under GNU FDL, pre-
vent people from relicencing our own documentation under it,
e.g. in the website licence, when possible, and ask them not
to do it otherwise. We must live with the FSF documentation,
but we do not allow committers to modify them unless changes
are assigned back to the FSF, to prevent additional require-
ments to burden us.


GNU GPL
-------

http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/msg/29c7588fbecd8289
and at http://www.symlink.ch/articles/06/12/18/1515227.shtml (German)

Despite FSF propaganda (FUD), the GNU GPL is not a viral li-
cence if you do not redistribute the end product of combina-
ting some work with a GPL licenced work. Dynamic linking and
dlopen(3) are not combining, as they are brought together at
run time only. GPLv2 section 0 says the act of running isn't
restricted. Mere aggregation of GPL and non-GPL work on some
medium (e.g. our installation sets) don't "infect" either.

The ChangeLog requirement is met by CVS logs (both the files
and the logs within the ,v files themselves). The source can
be obtained for free from our CVSweb unless distributed with
the MirOS release/snapshot you obtained. Note that the bina-
ries you receive need not correspond to the source code (for
non-GPL binaries only).

Opinions
-- -- --

>I believe if you include all of the sources in the exact state you
>used to build the binary that includes tinyirc as a part of it, as far
>as I'm concerned you've satisfied the license.
	-- Nathan Laredo

This was regarding crunchgen(1) and tinyirc. The solution was
to add tinyirc to a source tarball as usual, and link it only
against unmodified stock MirOS source from CVS, which is made
available via AnonCVS regularily and long-livingly.

GPLv3
-----

We do not yet have a stance on the GPLv3. No work covered by
that licence will be included in the MirOS base system, gcc,
and X11 modules. Ports should not be a problem, but for set-
ting the PERMIT_* flags, we will have to evaluate it first.


Obtaining source code
---------------------

On your MirOS Release CD, source code for the base system is
at /v{version}/source{version}.ngz and xfree{version}.ngz; a
link is placed in the machine-dependent subdirectories to be
able to easily install them.

Third-party sources for Release, Snapshot or Live CDs can be
obtained from /v{version}/[Dd]istfiles, or /[Dd]istfiles, or
/v{version}/[Dd]ist, or /[Dd]ist, if existent. Live CDs come
with the source code of packages pre-installed, unless these
have distfiles placed on the HTTP mirror(s), see below.

Source code for less free software that comes with MirOS, as
listed above, is available via CVSweb, anonCVS, or anonRSYNC
as described below.

Distfiles not on the distribution media
---------------------------------------

According to the GNU General Public License (Version 2), Section
3b, we hereby guarantee that, unless the required source code is
available on the same media (as per Section 3a), it shall be ac-
cessible to the general public on our HTTP download mirrors, for
at least three years after the initial release date of the media
and at no cost other than the expense of physically distributing
these files. Because HTTP mirrors is the medium customarily used
for software interchange, when it comes to "distfiles" of ports,
we do not offer any other means, unless the mirrors are not wor-
king. However, if you want the complete material downloadable at
our mirrors on fixed media, contact us and we'll send them, at a
little extra fee, to you, as an additional service going further
than what the GPL requires.

Distfiles covered by other licences shall be treated similarily.

The collective copyright assigned onto the whole of MirOS by
Thorsten Glaser as project leader does *not* cover the parts
licenced under any version of the GNU FDL.


Libraries under the GNU GPL without linking exception clause
------------------------------------------------------------

While building the base system, you'll see apparently weird-
looking messages, such as
objdump.o: Linking with libopcodes infects with the GNU General Public License!
objdump.o: Linking with libbfd infects with the GNU General Public License!
objdump.o: Linking with libiberty infects with the GNU General Public License!

We have tried to identify any potential source of GPL poiso-
ning in the MirOS source tree, and have started to do so for
MirPorts. If you should encounter these or similar infection
warning messages, this is informational - the actual licence
virus only gets active if the final, linked, binary is redi-
stributed. If we should have missed to identify a GPL'd lib-
rary which is installed during the release process, or you'd
like to help us with modifying MirPorts the same way, please
contact us immediately.

Licence blurb
-------------
Every single GNU-licensed (GPL, LGPL, etc.) file in this directory
is covered by the licence in the lowest possible version that is
written in the file, and relicensing files taken from MirOS under
later versions of e.g. the GPL (when the original file is, say,
GPLv1'd) is prohibited. You may of course ask the MirOS development
team, which will decide on a case by case basis. For some projects,
we are trying to assign back the copyright to the FSF (for practical
reasons, ignoring political problems); for these files this restriction
does not apply unless it's stated in the copyright header itself.

To remove GNU FDL licenced material we have been forced (see the above
blurb about documentation). This is a consensus that has been discussed
on the debian-legal mailing list. MirBSD, MirLinux (MirOS) strive to be
DFSG-free operating systems, with MirPorts being only a defined way to
locally add third-party packages (itself BSD-style licenced as well),
thus we took the consequence and removed GFDL-licenced documentation
from the installed base system and, where feasible, from the source,
except as described above.


Other particulars
-----------------

$OpenBSD: README,v 1.1 2001/08/18 13:12:57 espie Exp $

Some of the software in this subtree follows special rules.

Specifically, the FSF not only wants the GPL licence, but they
also insist that you assign your copyright to the FSF for anything
but trivial changes.

So:
- check the history of external code before importing it.
- be ready to arrange for copyright papers somewhat in advance if
you want to work on it (the FSF takes a few months to process these).

Otherwise, changes might not make it to the main distribution, and may
need some further maintenance over time, or risk getting lost.

Some internal changes are acceptable, but OpenBSD can't afford to maintain
a complete separate toolchain on its own.


Assigning copyright back to the FSF
-----------------------------------

The FSF demands this for accepting patches, and demands the agreement
be made under US law. Contributor retains his moral rights under European
"Droit d'Auteur" style law.

The following MirOS committers and contributors have standing
copyright assignments with the FSF:
- tg@@ (Thorsten Glaser)
	* all of src/gnu/
	* all of gcc/

Of the following persons related to MirOS/OpenBSD this is known, too:
- espie@@openbsd.org (Marc Espie)
- etoh@@openbsd.org (Hiroaki Etoh) - acceptance pending
- kettenis@@openbsd.org (Mark Kettenis) - pending
