@$MirOS: src/share/doc/legal/LICENCE,v 1.32 2018/01/07 23:27:33 tg Exp $

MirOS base system and BSD - TOU
-------------------------------

This is /usr/share/doc/legal/LICENCE, available online at
http://cvs.mirbsd.de/src/share/doc/legal/ or any other
CVSweb-enabled mirror, such as cvsweb.allbsd.org in Japan.

This file contains the terms and conditions which MirOS base
and MirOS BSD are covered under.

The MirOS Project consists of a loosely bound group of deve-
lopers of which most are Europe-based, some in Canada or USA
and some other places of the world; these developers work on
MirOS together as "committers" (people with direct write ac-
cess to MirOS) and former committers (together, authors), as
well as "contributors" who submit patches or help otherwise.
MirBSD is defined as the content of the MirOS Project's lea-
der's /usr/src and /usr/ports directories; usually MirOS BSD
and MirPorts; thus, MirOS is derived from MirBSD‚Ñ¢.

# MirBSD is Copyright ¬© 2002, 2018, 2019
#	mirabilos <m@@mirbsd.org>
# MirOS BSD, the MirPorts Framework, and all other project work is
# Copyright ¬© 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010,
#	      2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017
#	The MirOS Project and its contributors.
#
# Provided that these terms and disclaimer and all copyright notices
# are retained or reproduced in an accompanying document, permission
# is granted to deal in this work without restriction, including un-
# limited rights to use, publicly perform, distribute, sell, modify,
# merge, give away, or sublicence.
#
# This work is provided ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù and WITHOUT WARRANTY of any kind, to
# the utmost extent permitted by applicable law, neither express nor
# implied; without malicious intent or gross negligence. In no event
# may a licensor, author or contributor be held liable for indirect,
# direct, other damage, loss, or other issues arising in any way out
# of dealing in the work, even if advised of the possibility of such
# damage or existence of a defect, except proven that it results out
# of said person‚Äôs immediate fault when using the work as intended.

For an overview of all other terms and conditions that cover
parts of MirOS, refer to the file 1stREAD in the current di-
rectory and the files it refers to.

The MirOS Project strives to make as much of our work as po-
ssible, as well as inherited work we redistribute, available
under OSD compliant licences (see www.opensource.org), where
OSI certification is not a requirement, due to braindead po-
licies of OSI.
We strongly request people to not reuse our work in material
covered by problematic licences such as the GNU FDL.
Parts of the code and documentation inherited are not publi‚Äê
shed under such free licences (mostly PD and GFDL); while we
can still distribute them we acknowledge they are a problem,
minimise them and seek for better alternatives‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhile still
distributing works where we believe that to not be unlawful.

We ask all of our contributors to publish their work under a
licence boilerplate derived from the "licence.template" file
and request them to always use the disclaimer shown in this,
even if contributor is not bound by EU law.
We also ask all contributors to be: either at least 18 years
old, or at least 7 years old and have been given a parental,
generic permit to do business related to open source softwa-
re (or at least specific to MirOS), which enables them to be
fully contractually capable for this specific area of deals.
Contributor is responsible to provide the parental statement
in non-electronic form, giving this permission, if required,
and a proof of age, on request.

he is liable for knowingly inserted work or malice intent as
well as for integrating work which other parties have rights
but we no licence. We also ask all contributors to be either
at least 18 years old, or at least 7 years old and have been
given by their parents a generic permit to do business rela-
ted to open source software (or at least specific to MirOS),
which makes them fully contractually capable for this speci-
fic area of deals. Contributor is responsible to provide the
parental statement, in non-electronic form, giving this all-
owance, or a proof of age, on request.
With the knowledge every committer accepts certain liability
we indemnify our official mirrors from any claims arising of
the fact they are mirroring MirOS material, and ask projects
hosted by us to fully indemnify us and our official mirrors,
too.
