@$MirOS: src/share/doc/legal/1stREAD,v 1.7 2008/11/08 22:23:53 tg Exp $

LICENCE OVERVIEW
----------------

This is /usr/share/doc/legal/1stREAD, available online under
http://cvs.mirbsd.de/src/share/doc/legal/ or any other MirOS
CVSweb enabled mirror.

This file's purpose is to give a complete overview about the
various files that in their totalness describe the terms and
conditions MirOS is covered by.

The other modules' (ports, gcc and x11) licences are not de-
scribed herein; instead, refer to the top-level README files
for each module. The "contrib" module doesn't have a central
licencing repository.

/usr/share/doc/legal/1stREAD
	This file.

/usr/share/doc/legal/LICENCE
	The MirBSD Collective Work Licence, as well as
	the MirOS Project's author and contributor list.

/usr/share/doc/legal/LICENCE-BSD
	A file compiled from the various, mostly historic
	but still applying, licence terms the BSD-based
	MirOS is covered by in parts. None of these terms
	cover all of MirOS, but only some parts. They also
	describe the Berkeley history and our contributors.
	The collective-work copyright on "MirBSD" and the
	licence is also contained in this file.

/usr/share/doc/legal/LICENCE-GNU
	Description of special "rules" for the src/gnu/
	realm of the MirOS source tree, as well as the
	"gnuXX.ngz" distribution set, and the split-out
	"devXX.ngz" distribution set and gcc/ in CVS.

/usr/share/doc/legal/COPYING-1
	A true and verbatim copy of the GNU General
	Public License, Version 1, as it covers parts
	of MirOS' gnu realm and contrib/code/jupp.

/usr/share/doc/legal/COPYING-2
	The GNU General Public License, Version 2.

/usr/share/doc/legal/COPYING.LIB-2
	The GNU Library General Public License, Version 2.

/usr/share/doc/legal/COPYING.LIB-2_1
	The GNU Lesser General Public License, Version 2.1.

/usr/share/doc/legal/LICENCE.httpd
	The terms and conditions for the HTTP daemon which
	is part of the MirOS base system.

/usr/share/doc/legal/LICENCE.smtpd
	The terms and conditions for the SMTP daemon which
	comes with the MirOS base system.

/usr/share/misc/licence.template
	The MirOS Licence Template is the preferred boiler-
	plate to be put on new files.

mircvs://src/share/misc/Attic/license.template
	The OpenBSD/ISC license template is an acceptable
	OSI approved licence with weaker phrasing and a
	disclaimer not optimal for protection under EU law.
	Thusly it is no longer installed by default.


To the best of our ("our" as in, The MirOS Project, as defi-
ned through its list of committers, as denoted in ./LICENCE)
knowledge, this is a true and accurate list of all terms and
conditions the MirOS base system and BSD kernel is under. To
the best of our knowledge, the advertising clauses listed in
the ./LICENCE-BSD file is representative for and complete to
MirOS base with BSD kernel, contributed GCC and MirPorts. If
you think there is a possible case of copyright violation or
licence non-compliance within the MirOS' CVS repository, web
sites and download area, please don't hesitate to immediate-
ly contact me at <nc-glaserth@@netcologne.de> personally.


Thanks for your cooperation and much fun with our products!

No complete transition yet, but this helps a lot with
the recent and upcoming(!) domain issues.

Please use only http://mirbsd.de/ as mirror redirector
and only http://cvs.mirbsd.de/ as CVSweb redirector.
Please do not use mirbsd.de for anything else save eMail.
