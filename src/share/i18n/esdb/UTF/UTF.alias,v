@add the *HE (host endianness) aliases

I guess we can safely skip UCS-4PE (PDP endian) though...

@revert rev. 1.2, the change was bogus

to implement CESU-8 within citrus, I'd have to draft a new
encoding because of the existing limitations; the correct
way to read utf-8 is to call iconv from utf-8 to utf-16he
and then directly use the result as (wchar_t *); then use
wcsrtombs to convert to CESU-8 if desired

log
@add CESU-8 as alias for UTF-8 since that is what we actually
use system-wide, outside of citrus (since our wchar_t is BMP
only)

XXX add CESU-8 read/write to citrus_utf8.c, no explicit op-
XXX tion to switch CESU-8 write on, just use wchar size

yes I know, CESU-8 "should not be used to interchange data",
but there is no way (outside of citrus) within mirbsd to in-
terchange UCS-4 data other than as UTF-16 (wchar_t *) or
CESU-8 (char *) strings, or convert them.
