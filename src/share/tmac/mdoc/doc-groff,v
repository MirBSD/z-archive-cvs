@work around AT&T nroff operating in page mode by replacing vspace calls
(.sp and 'sp) by calls to a macro (.SP $1 and 'SP $1 nobreak) that first
checks if the space requested still fits on this page, and, if not,
shortens (!) this page by whatever size it still has, then flushs it,
and only then it emits the requested vertical space

@• get portmdoc the fixes from tmac/mdoc/doc-groff
  (tested with mksh.1 manpage: works with AT&T nroff due to .if)
• get macro definitions from portmdoc into tmac/mdoc/doc-nroff
• copy changes from tmac/mdoc/doc-nroff into share/tmac/mdoc/doc-ditroff
• add comments and macros from portmdoc into share/tmac/mdoc/doc-groff
• do not %beginstrip share/tmac/mdoc/doc-groff due to its complexity
• add short usage into tmac/mdoc/doc-nroff before %beginstrip as well

@according to groff_char(7) and my own hard experiences, there is more wrong
with GNU groff – add some special handling to the BSD mdoc macros for it so
that the manual pages look good in both utf8 and ps (PDF) mode; also fix in
mksh wrong display of ` (groff: ‘), ' (groff: ’), \' (groff: ´), \- (groff:
U+2212 −), the en dash (nroff doesn’t have it, use the em dash there ONLY),
and ~ and ^ (groff: placed atop and size-reduced, for use as diacritics, in
manual pages bad since these are control characters there)
→ PDF manpage now has ‘’ “” and good-looking hyphens and mini and ~ and ^
→ utf8 manpage now has ‘’ “”, good-looking hyphens, cut’n’pasteable mini
→ nroff manpage still has '' "" instead of ugly `' ``'' or even `´
→ Debian lintian won’t complain any longer
