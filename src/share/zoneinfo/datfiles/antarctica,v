# From Craig Mundell (1994-12-15)</a>:
# Vostok, which is one of the Russian stations, is set on the same
# time as Moscow, Russia.
#
# From Lee Hotz (2001-03-08):
# I queried the folks at Columbia who spent the summer at Vostok and this is
# what they had to say about time there:
# ``in the US Camp (East Camp) we have been on New Zealand (McMurdo)
# time, which is 12 hours ahead of GMT. The Russian Station Vostok was
# 6 hours behind that (although only 2 miles away, i.e. 6 hours ahead
# of GMT). This is a time zone I think two hours east of Moscow. The
# natural time zone is in between the two: 8 hours ahead of GMT.''
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-05-04):
# This seems to be hopelessly confusing, so I asked Lee Hotz about it
# in person.  He said that some Antartic locations set their local
# time so that noon is the warmest part of the day, and that this
# changes during the year and does not necessarily correspond to mean
# solar noon.  So the Vostok time might have been whatever the clocks
# happened to be during their visit.  So we still don't really know what time
# it is at Vostok.  But we'll guess UTC+6.

# larger Antarctica/McMurdo since 1970, but it's too famous to omit.
#
# From Chris Carrier <72157.3334@@CompuServe.COM> (1996-06-27):
# Siple, the first commander of the South Pole station,
# stated that he would have liked to have kept GMT at the station,
# but that he found it more convenient to keep GMT+12
# as supplies for the station were coming from McMurdo Sound,
# which was on GMT+12 because New Zealand was on GMT+12 all year
# at that time (1957).  (Source: Siple's book 90 degrees SOUTH.)
#
# From Susan Smith
# http://www.cybertours.com/whs/pole10.html
# (1995-11-13 16:24:56 +1300, no longer available):
# We use the same time as McMurdo does.
# And they use the same time as Christchurch, NZ does....
# One last quirk about South Pole time.
# All the electric clocks are usually wrong.
# Something about the generators running at 60.1hertz or something
# makes all of the clocks run fast.  So every couple of days,
# we have to go around and set them back 5 minutes or so.
# Maybe if we let them run fast all of the time, we'd get to leave here sooner!!

# From Steffen Thorsen (2009-03-11):
# Three Australian stations in Antarctica have changed their time zone:
# Casey moved from UTC+8 to UTC+11
# Davis moved from UTC+7 to UTC+5
# Mawson moved from UTC+6 to UTC+5
# The changes occurred on 2009-10-18 at 02:00 (local times).

# http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/antarctica-new-times.html
# </a>

# From Steffen Thorsen (2010-03-10):
# We got these changes from the Australian Antarctic Division:
# - Macquarie Island will stay on UTC+11 for winter and therefore not
# switch back from daylight savings time when other parts of Australia do
# on 4 April.
#
# - Casey station reverted to its normal time of UTC+8 on 5 March 2010.
# The change to UTC+11 is being considered as a regular summer thing but
# has not been decided yet.
#
# - Davis station will revert to its normal time of UTC+7 at 10 March 2010
# 20:00 UTC.
#
# - Mawson station stays on UTC+5.
#
# In addition to the Rule changes for Casey/Davis, it means that Macquarie
# will no longer be like Hobart and will have to have its own Zone created.

#
# From Paul-Inge Flakstad (2014-03-10):
# I recently had a long dialog about this with the developer of timegenie.com.
# In the absence of specific dates, he decided to choose some likely ones:
#   GMT +1 - From March 1 to the last Sunday in March
#   GMT +2 - From the last Sunday in March until the last Sunday in October
#   GMT +1 - From the last Sunday in October until November 7
#   GMT +0 - From November 7 until March 1
# The dates for switching to and from UTC+0 will probably not be absolutely
# correct, but they should be quite close to the actual dates.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2014-03-21):
# The CET-switching Troll rules require zic from tzcode 2014b or later, so as
# suggested by Bengt-Inge Larsson comment them out for now, and approximate
# with only UTC and CEST.  Uncomment them when 2014b is more prevalent.

@Import tzdata2007a via OpenBSD
NB: I'm not importing tzcode because there are some major changes,
    a new TZif format/version (not yet enabled, but 64-bit safe) -
    which is the minor problem - and some changes to the code with
    yet not analysed implications
