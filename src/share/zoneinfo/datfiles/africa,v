# This data is by no means authoritative; if you think you know better,
# go ahead and edit the file (and please send any changes to
# tz@@elsie.nci.nih.gov for general use in the future).

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@@twinsun.com> (1999-03-22):
#
# A good source for time zone historical data outside the U.S. is
# Thomas G. Shanks, The International Atlas (5th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1999).
#
# Gwillim Law writes that a good source
# for recent time zone data is the International Air Transport
# Association's Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
# published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
# of the IATA's data after 1990.
#
# Except where otherwise noted, Shanks is the source for entries through 1990,
# and IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
#
# Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
# Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
# I found in the UCLA library.
#
# A reliable and entertaining source about time zones is
# Derek Howse, Greenwich time and longitude, Philip Wilson Publishers (1997).
#
# Previous editions of this database used WAT, CAT, SAT, and EAT
# for +0:00 through +3:00, respectively,
# but Mark R V Murray <markm@@grondar.za> reports that
# `SAST' is the official abbreviation for +2:00 in the country of South Africa,
# `CAT' is commonly used for +2:00 in countries north of South Africa, and
# `WAT' is probably the best name for +1:00, as the common phrase for
# the area that includes Nigeria is ``West Africa''.
# He has heard of ``Western Sahara Time'' for +0:00 but can find no reference.
#
# To make things confusing, `WAT' seems to have been used for -1:00 long ago;
# I'd guess that this was because people needed _some_ name for -1:00,
# and at the time, far west Africa was the only major land area in -1:00.
# This usage is now obsolete, as the last use of -1:00 on the African
# mainland seems to have been 1976 in Western Sahara.
#
# To summarize, the following abbreviations seem to have some currency:
#	-1:00	WAT	West Africa Time (no longer used)
#	 0:00	GMT	Greenwich Mean Time
#	 2:00	CAT	Central Africa Time
#	 2:00	SAST	South Africa Standard Time
# and Murray suggests the following abbreviation:
#	 1:00	WAT	West Africa Time
# I realize that this leads to `WAT' being used for both -1:00 and 1:00
# for times before 1976, but this is the best I can think of
# until we get more information.
#
# I invented the following abbreviations; corrections are welcome!
#	 2:00	WAST	West Africa Summer Time
#	 2:30	BEAT	British East Africa Time (no longer used)
#	 2:44:45 BEAUT	British East Africa Unified Time (no longer used)
#	 3:00	CAST	Central Africa Summer Time (no longer used)
#	 3:00	SAST	South Africa Summer Time (no longer used)
#	 3:00	EAT	East Africa Time
#	 4:00	EAST	East Africa Summer Time (no longer used)

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-07-10):
# According to

# (in French), Mauritius will start and end their DST a few days earlier
# than previously announced (2008-11-01 to 2009-03-31).  The new start
# date is 2008-10-26 at 02:00 and the new end date is 2009-03-27 (no time
# given, but it is probably at either 2 or 3 wall clock time).
# 
# A little strange though, since the article says that they moved the date 
# to align itself with Europe and USA which also change time on that date, 
# but that means they have not paid attention to what happened in 
# USA/Canada last year (DST ends first Sunday in November). I also wonder 
# why that they end on a Friday, instead of aligning with Europe which 
# changes two days later.

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-07-11):
# Seems that English language article "The revival of daylight saving
# time:  Energy conservation?"-# No. 16578 (07/11/2008) was originally
# published on Monday, June 30, 2008...
#
# I guess that article in French "Le gouvernement avance l'introduction
# de l'heure d'ete" stating that DST in Mauritius starting on October 26
# and ending on March 27, 2009 is the most recent one.

# Cabinet Decision of July 18th, 2008 states as follows:
#
# 4. ...Cabinet has agreed to the introduction into the National Assembly
# of the Time Bill which provides for the introduction of summer time in
# Mauritius. The summer time period which will be of one hour ahead of
# the standard time, will be aligned with that in Europe and the United
# States of America. It will start at two o'clock in the morning on the
# last Sunday of October and will end at two o'clock in the morning on
# the last Sunday of March the following year. The summer time for the
# year 2008 - 2009 will, therefore, be effective as from 26 October 2008
# and end on 29 March 2009.

# From Ed Maste (2008-10-07):
# THE TIME BILL (No. XXVII of 2008) Explanatory Memorandum states the
# beginning / ending of summer time is 2 o'clock standard time in the
# morning of the last Sunday of October / last Sunday of March.

# The 1994-04-03 transition is from Shanks & Pottenger.
# Shanks & Pottenger report no DST after 1998-04; go with IATA.

# From Petronella Sibeene (2007-03-30) in
# <http://allafrica.com/stories/200703300178.html>:
# While the entire country changes its time, Katima Mulilo and other
# settlements in Caprivi unofficially will not because the sun there
# rises and sets earlier compared to other regions.  Chief of
# Forecasting Riaan van Zyl explained that the far eastern parts of
# the country are close to 40 minutes earlier in sunrise than the rest
# of the country.
# 
# From Paul Eggert (2007-03-31):
# Apparently the Caprivi Strip informally observes Botswana time, but
# we have no details.  In the meantime people there can use Africa/Gaborone.

# and dated 2005-04-26, "Tunisia has decided to advance its official time by
# one hour, starting on Sunday, May 1.  Henceforth, Tunisian time will be
# UTC+2 instead of UTC+1.  The change will take place at 23:00 UTC next
# Saturday."  (My translation)

# From Arthur David Olson (2009--3-18):
# The Tunis Afrique Presse News Agency notice contains this: "This measure is due to the fact
# that the fasting month of ramadan coincides with the period concerned by summer time.
# Therefore, the standard time will be kept unchanged the whole year long."
# So foregoing DST seems to be an exception (albeit one that may be repeated in the  future).

# From Paul Eggert (2013-07-03):
# To estimate what the Moroccan government will do in future years,
# transition dates for 2014 through 2021 were determined by running
# the following program under GNU Emacs 24.3:
#
# (let ((islamic-year 1435))
#   (while (< islamic-year 1444)
#     (let ((a
#	     (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute

#	    (b
#	     (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute

#	(insert
#	 (format
#	  (concat "Rule\tMorocco\t%d\tonly\t-\t%s\t %2d\t 3:00\t0\t-\n"
#		  "Rule\tMorocco\t%d\tonly\t-\t%s\t %2d\t 2:00\t1:00\tS\n")
#	  (car (cdr (cdr a))) (calendar-month-name (car a) t) (car (cdr a))
#	  (car (cdr (cdr b))) (calendar-month-name (car b) t) (car (cdr b)))))
#     (setq islamic-year (+ 1 islamic-year))))
#
# with the results hand-edited for 2020-2022, when the normal spring-forward
# date falls during the estimated Ramadan.
#
# From 2023 through 2038 Ramadan is not predicted to overlap with
# daylight saving time.  Starting in 2039 there will be overlap again,
# but 32-bit time_t values roll around in 2038 so for now do not worry
# about dates after 2038.

# before it was going to end.  There is a new decree (2.13.781) for
# this, where DST from now on goes from last Sunday of March at 02:00
# to last Sunday of October at 03:00, similar to EU rules.  Official
# source (French):

# with spring-forward transitions removed for 2023-2025, when the
# normal spring-forward date falls during the estimated Ramadan; with
# all transitions removed for 2026-2035, where the estimated Ramadan
# falls entirely outside daylight-saving time; and with fall-back
# transitions removed for 2036-2037, where the normal fall-back
# date falls during the estimated Ramadan.  Normally, the table would
# stop after 2037 because 32-bit time_t values roll around early in 2038,
# but that would imply a prediction of perpetual DST after March 2038
# due to the year-2037 glitches.  So, this table instead stops after
# 2038, the first non-glitchy year after the 32-bit rollover.
# An advantage of stopping after 2038 is that it lets zic guess
# TZ='WET0WEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3' for time stamps far in the future.

# Egypt is to change back to Daylight system on May 15
# http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/100735/Egypt/Politics-/Egypts-government-to-reapply-daylight-saving-time-.aspx

# From Gunther Vermier (2015-05-13):
# our Egypt office confirms that the change will be at 15 May "midnight" (24:00)

# From Paul Eggert (2014-05-13):
# Sarah El Deeb and Lee Keath of AP report that the Egyptian government says
# the change is because of blackouts in Cairo, even though Ahram Online (cited
# above) says DST had no affect on electricity consumption.  The AP story says
# DST will not be observed during Ramadan.  There is no information about when
# DST will end.  See:
# http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/el-sissi-pushes-egyptians-line-23614833
#
# For now, guess that later transitions will use 2010's rules, and that
# Egypt will agree with Morocco (see below) about the date Ramadan starts and
# ends, though (unlike Morocco) it will switch at 00:00 standard time.  In
# Egypt the spring-forward transitions are removed for 2020-2022, when the
# guessed spring-forward date falls during the estimated Ramadan, and all
# transitions removed for 2023-2038, where the estimated Ramadan falls entirely
# outside the guessed daylight-saving time.  Ramadan intrudes on the guessed
# DST starting in 2039, but that's beyond our somewhat-arbitrary cutoff.

# The Tunis Afrique Presse News Agency notice contains this: "This measure is
# due to the fact that the fasting month of Ramadan coincides with the period
# concerned by summer time.  Therefore, the standard time will be kept
# unchanged the whole year long."  So foregoing DST seems to be an exception
# (albeit one that may be repeated in the future).

# tzdb data for Africa and environs

# From Paul Eggert (2018-05-27):

# I invented the following abbreviations in the 1990s:
d56 2
a57 2
#	 +03	CAST	Central Africa Summer Time
#	 +03	SAST	South Africa Summer Time
d59 2
a60 4
# 'EAT' seems to have caught on and is in current timestamps, and though
# the other abbreviations are rarer and are only in past timestamps,
# they are paired with better-attested non-DST abbreviations.
# Corrections are welcome.
a364 7
#
# Unfortunately tzdb records only Western clock time in use in Ethiopia,
# as the tzdb format is not up to properly recording a common Ethiopian
# timekeeping practice that is based on solar time.  See:
# Mortada D. If you have a meeting in Ethiopia, you'd better double
# check the time. PRI's The World. 2015-01-30 15:15 -05.

# From Michael Deckers (2017-04-06):
# ... both summer and winter time are called "standard"
# (which differs from the use in Ireland) ...

a994 9
# From Paul Eggert (2017-04-09):
# Before the change, summer and winter time were both standard time legally.
# However in common parlance, winter time was considered to be DST.  See, e.g.:
# http://www.nbc.na/news/namibias-winter-time-could-be-scrapped.2706
# https://zone.my.na/news/times-are-changing-in-namibia
# https://www.newera.com.na/2017/02/23/namibias-winter-time-might-be-repealed/
# Use plain "WAT" and "CAT" for the time zone abbreviations, to be compatible
# with Namibia's neighbors.

#
# From Maamar Abdelkader (2018-11-01):
# We usually move clocks back the previous week end and come back to the +1
# the week end after....  The government does not announce yet the decision
# about this temporary change.  But it s 99% sure that it will be the case,
# as in previous years.  An unofficial survey was done these days, showing
# that 64% of asked peopke are ok for moving from +1 to +0 during Ramadan.

# For now, guess that Morocco will fall back at 03:00 the last Sunday

# following program under GNU Emacs 26.1.

@Import tzdata2007a via OpenBSD
NB: I'm not importing tzcode because there are some major changes,
    a new TZif format/version (not yet enabled, but 64-bit safe) -
    which is the minor problem - and some changes to the code with
    yet not analysed implications
