# This data is by no means authoritative; if you think you know better,
# go ahead and edit the file (and please send any changes to
# tz@@elsie.nci.nih.gov for general use in the future).

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@@twinsun.com> (1999-07-07):
# A good source for time zone historical data outside the U.S. is
# Thomas G. Shanks, The International Atlas (5th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1999).
#
# Gwillim Law writes that a good source
# for recent time zone data is the International Air Transport
# Association's Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
# published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
# of the IATA's data after 1990.
#
# Except where otherwise noted, Shanks is the source for entries through 1990,
# and IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
#
# Earlier editions of these tables used the North American style (e.g. ARST and
# ARDT for Argentine Standard and Daylight Time), but the following quote
# suggests that it's better to use European style (e.g. ART and ARST).
#	I suggest the use of _Summer time_ instead of the more cumbersome
#	_daylight-saving time_.  _Summer time_ seems to be in general use
#	in Europe and South America.
#	-- E O Cutler, _New York Times_ (1937-02-14), quoted in
#	H L Mencken, _The American Language: Supplement I_ (1960), p 466
#
# Earlier editions of these tables also used the North American style
# for time zones in Brazil, but this was incorrect, as Brazilians say
# "summer time".  Reinaldo Goulart, a Sao Paulo businessman active in
# the railroad sector, writes (1999-07-06):
#	The subject of time zones is currently a matter of discussion/debate in
#	Brazil.  Let's say that "the Brasilia time" is considered the
#	"official time" because Brasilia is the capital city.
#	The other three time zones are called "Brasilia time "minus one" or
#	"plus one" or "plus two".  As far as I know there is no such
#	name/designation as "Eastern Time" or "Central Time".
# So I invented the following (English-language) abbreviations for now.
# Corrections are welcome!

# From Peter Gradelski via Steffen Thorsen (2000-03-01):
# We just checked with our Sao Paulo office and they say the government of
# Argentina decided not to become one of the countries that go on or off DST.
# So Buenos Aires should be -3 hours from GMT at all times.
#
# From Fabian L. Arce Jofre <farcejofre@@bigfoot.com> (2000-04-04):
# The law that claimed DST for Argentina was derogated by President Fernando
# de la Rua on March 2, 2000, because it would make people spend more energy
# in the winter time, rather than less.  The change took effect on March 3.
#
# From Mariano Absatz (2001-06-06):
# one of the major newspapers here in Argentina said that the 1999
# Timezone Law (which never was effectively applied) will (would?) be
# in effect.... The article is at
# http://ar.clarin.com/diario/2001-06-06/e-01701.htm
# ... The Law itself is "Ley No 25155", sanctioned on 1999-08-25, enacted
# 1999-09-17, and published 1999-09-21.  The official publication is at:
# http://www.boletin.jus.gov.ar/BON/Primera/1999/09-Septiembre/21/PDF/BO21-09-99LEG.PDF
# Regretfully, you have to subscribe (and pay) for the on-line version....
#
# (2001-06-12):
# the timezone for Argentina will not change next Sunday.
# Apparently it will do so on Sunday 24th....
# http://ar.clarin.com/diario/2001-06-12/s-03501.htm
#
# (2001-06-25):
# Last Friday (yes, the last working day before the date of the change), the
# Senate annulled the 1999 law that introduced the changes later postponed.
# http://www.clarin.com.ar/diario/2001-06-22/s-03601.htm
# It remains the vote of the Deputies..., but it will be the same....
# This kind of things had always been done this way in Argentina.
# We are still -03:00 all year round in all of the country.
#
# From Mariano Absatz (2004-05-21):
# Today it was officially published that the Province of Mendoza is changing
# its timezone this winter... starting tomorrow night....
# http://www.gobernac.mendoza.gov.ar/boletin/pdf/20040521-27158-normas.pdf
# From Paul Eggert (2004-05-24):
# It's Law No. 7,210.  This change is due to a public power emergency, so for
# now we'll assume it's for this year only.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2002-01-22):
# <a href="http://www.spicasc.net/horvera.html">
# Hora de verano para la Republica Argentina (2000-10-01)
# </a> says that standard time in Argentina from 1894-10-31
# to 1920-05-01 was -4:16:48.25.  Go with this more-precise value
# over Shanks.
#
# From Mariano Absatz (2004-06-05):
# These media articles from a major newspaper mostly cover the current state:
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/05/27/de_604825.asp
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/05/28/de_605203.asp
#
# The following eight (8) provinces pulled clocks back to UTC-04:00 at
# midnight Monday May 31st. (that is, the night between 05/31 and 06/01).
# Apparently, all nine provinces would go back to UTC-03:00 at the same
# time in October 17th.
#
# Catamarca, Chubut, La Rioja, San Juan, San Luis, Santa Cruz,
# Tierra del Fuego, Tucuman.
#
# From Mariano Absatz (2004-06-14):
# ... this weekend, the Province of Tucuman decided it'd go back to UTC-03:00
# yesterday midnight (that is, at 24:00 Saturday 12th), since the people's
# annoyance with the change is much higher than the power savings obtained....
#
# From Gwillim Law (2004-06-14):
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/06/10/de_609078.asp ...
#     "The time change in Tierra del Fuego was a conflicted decision from
#   the start.  The government had decreed that the measure would take
#   effect on June 1, but a normative error forced the new time to begin
#   three days earlier, from a Saturday to a Sunday....
# Our understanding was that the change was originally scheduled to take place
# on June 1 at 00:00 in Chubut, Santa Cruz, Tierra del Fuego (and some other
# provinces).  Sunday was May 30, only two days earlier.  So the article
# contains a contradiction.  I would give more credence to the Saturday/Sunday
# date than the "three days earlier" phrase, and conclude that Tierra del
# Fuego set its clocks back at 2004-05-30 00:00.
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2004-10-05):
# The previous law 7210 which changed the province of Mendoza's time zone
# back in May have been modified slightly in a new law 7277, which set the
# new end date to 2004-09-26 (original date was 2004-10-17).
# http://www.gobernac.mendoza.gov.ar/boletin/pdf/20040924-27244-normas.pdf
#
# From Mariano Absatz (2004-10-05):
# San Juan changed from UTC-03:00 to UTC-04:00 at midnight between
# Sunday, May 30th and Monday, May 31st.  It changed back to UTC-03:00
# at midnight between Saturday, July 24th and Sunday, July 25th....

# Brazil

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@@twinsun.com> (1993-11-18):
# The mayor of Rio recently attempted to change the time zone rules
# just in his city, in order to leave more summer time for the tourist trade.
# The rule change lasted only part of the day;
# the federal government refused to follow the city's rules, and business
# was in a chaos, so the mayor backed down that afternoon.

# From IATA SSIM (1996-02):
# _Only_ the following states in BR1 observe DST: Rio Grande do Sul (RS),
# Santa Catarina (SC), Parana (PR), Sao Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ),
# Espirito Santo (ES), Minas Gerais (MG), Bahia (BA), Goias (GO),
# Distrito Federal (DF), Tocantins (TO), Sergipe [SE] and Alagoas [AL].
# [The last three states are new to this issue of the IATA SSIM.]

# From Gwillim Law (1996-10-07):
# Geography, history (Tocantins was part of Goias until 1989), and other
# sources of time zone information lead me to believe that AL, SE, and TO were
# always in BR1, and so the only change was whether or not they observed DST....
# The earliest issue of the SSIM I have is 2/91.  Each issue from then until
# 9/95 says that DST is observed only in the ten states I quoted from 9/95,
# along with Mato Grosso (MT) and Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), which are in BR2
# (UTC-4)....  The other two time zones given for Brazil are BR3, which is
# UTC-5, no DST, and applies only in the state of Acre (AC); and BR4, which is
# UTC-2, and applies to Fernando de Noronha (formerly FN, but I believe it's
# become part of the state of Pernambuco).  The boundary between BR1 and BR2
# has never been clearly stated.  They've simply been called East and West.
# However, some conclusions can be drawn from another IATA manual: the Airline
# Coding Directory, which lists close to 400 airports in Brazil.  For each
# airport it gives a time zone which is coded to the SSIM.  From that
# information, I'm led to conclude that the states of Amapa (AP), Ceara (CE),
# Maranhao (MA), Paraiba (PR), Pernambuco (PE), Piaui (PI), and Rio Grande do
# Norte (RN), and the eastern part of Para (PA) are all in BR1 without DST.

# From Marcos Tadeu (1998-09-27):
# <a href="http://pcdsh01.on.br/verao1.html">
# Brazilian official page
# </a>

# From Jesper Norgaard (2000-11-03):
# [For an official list of which regions in Brazil use which time zones, see:]
# http://pcdsh01.on.br/Fusbr.htm
# http://pcdsh01.on.br/Fusbrhv.htm

# From Celso Doria via David Madeo (2002-10-09):
# The reason for the delay this year has to do with elections in Brazil.
#
# Unlike in the United States, elections in Brazil are 100% computerized and
# the results are known almost immediately.  Yesterday, it was the first
# round of the elections when 115 million Brazilians voted for President,
# Governor, Senators, Federal Deputies, and State Deputies.  Nobody is
# counting (or re-counting) votes anymore and we know there will be a second
# round for the Presidency and also for some Governors.  The 2nd round will
# take place on October 27th.
#
# The reason why the DST will only begin November 3rd is that the thousands
# of electoral machines used cannot have their time changed, and since the
# Constitution says the elections must begin at 8:00 AM and end at 5:00 PM,
# the Government decided to postpone DST, instead of changing the Constitution
# (maybe, for the next elections, it will be possible to change the clock)...

# From Rodrigo Severo (2004-10-04):
# It's just the biannual change made necessary by the much hyped, supposedly
# modern Brazilian eletronic voting machines which, apparently, can't deal
# with a time change between the first and the second rounds of the elections.

# From Paul Eggert (2002-10-10):
# The official decrees referenced below are mostly taken from
# <a href="http://pcdsh01.on.br/DecHV.html">

# Chile

# From Eduardo Krell (1995-10-19):
# The law says to switch to DST at midnight [24:00] on the second SATURDAY
# of October....  The law is the same for March and October.
# (1998-09-29):
# Because of the drought this year, the government decided to go into
# DST earlier (saturday 9/26 at 24:00). This is a one-time change only ...
# (unless there's another dry season next year, I guess).

# From Julio I. Pacheco Troncoso (1999-03-18):
# Because of the same drought, the government decided to end DST later,
# on April 3, (one-time change).

# From Gwillim Law (2001-05-04):
# I came across another article in "La Tercera" about Chilean DST.
# <http://www.tercera.cl/diario/2000/10/13/t-extras.html>
# It clearly confirms my earlier suggestion, that DST begins at 22:00
# on Easter Island....  But it also seems to be saying that the
# observance of DST in Chile began in 1966, rather than 1969 as
# ... [Shanks] has it....
#
# My translation:
#
# "The Chilean Army has announced that summer time will begin tomorrow,
# Saturday, October 14 in continental Chile, insular Chile, and
# Antarctica, as provided by Supreme Decree 25 of January 11, 1966.
# By the preceding, official time in continental Chile and Chilean
# Antarctic, and official time in Western Insular Chile, which applies
# to Easter Island and Sala y Gomez Island, will be set forward at
# midnight and at 22:00, respectively, by 20 minutes."

# From Paul Eggert (2001-05-04):
# Go with this article in preference to Shanks's 1969 date for modern DST.
# Assume this rule has been used since DST was introduced in the islands.

# From Paul Eggert (2002-10-24):
# <http://www.shoa.cl/shoa/faqhoraoficial.htm> gives many details that
# disagree with the following table, but we haven't had time to compare them.

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-05):
# Between 1990 and 2000 inclusive, Shanks and the IATA agree except
# the IATA gives 1996-09-08.  Go with Shanks.

# From Falkland Islands Government Office, London (2001-01-22)
# via Jesper Norgaard:
# ... the clocks revert back to Local Mean Time at 2 am on Sunday 15
# April 2001 and advance one hour to summer time at 2 am on Sunday 2
# September.  It is anticipated that the clocks will revert back at 2
# am on Sunday 21 April 2002 and advance to summer time at 2 am on
# Sunday 1 September.

# From Rives McDow (2001-02-13):
#
# I have communicated several times with people there, and the last
# time I had communications that was helpful was in 1998.  Here is
# what was said then:
#
# "The general rule was that Stanley used daylight saving and the Camp
# did not. However for various reasons many people in the Camp have
# started to use daylight saving (known locally as 'Stanley Time')
# There is no rule as to who uses daylight saving - it is a matter of
# personal choice and so it is impossible to draw a map showing who
# uses it and who does not. Any list would be out of date as soon as
# it was produced. This year daylight saving ended on April 18/19th
# and started again on September 12/13th.  I do not know what the rule
# is, but can find out if you like.  We do not change at the same time
# as UK or Chile."
#
# I did have in my notes that the rule was "Second Saturday in Sep at
# 0:00 until third Saturday in Apr at 0:00".  I think that this does
# not agree in some cases with Shanks; is this true?
#
# Also, there is no mention in the list that some areas in the
# Falklands do not use DST.  I have found in my communications there
# that these areas are on the western half of East Falkland and all of
# West Falkland.  Stanley is the only place that consistently observes
# DST.  Again, as in other places in the world, the farmers don't like
# it.  West Falkland is almost entirely sheep farmers.
#
# I know one lady there that keeps a list of which farm keeps DST and
# which doesn't each year.  She runs a shop in Stanley, and says that
# the list changes each year.  She uses it to communicate to her
# customers, catching them when they are home for lunch or dinner.

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-05):
# For now, we'll just record the time in Stanley, since we have no
# better info.

# From Jesper Norgaard Welen (2008-01-18):
# The page of the San Luis provincial government

# http://www.sanluis.gov.ar/notas.asp?idCanal=0&id=22812
# </a>
# confirms what Alex Krivenyshev has earlier sent to the tz
# emailing list about that San Luis plans to return to standard
# time much earlier than the rest of the country. It also
# confirms that upon request the provinces San Juan and Mendoza 
# refused to follow San Luis in this change. 
# 
# The change is supposed to take place Monday the 21.st at 0:00
# hours. As far as I understand it if this goes ahead, we need
# a new timezone for San Luis (although there are also documented
# independent changes in the southamerica file of San Luis in
# 1990 and 1991 which has not been confirmed).

# From Jesper Norgaard Welen (2008-01-25):
# Unfortunately the below page has become defunct, about the San Luis
# time change. Perhaps because it now is part of a group of pages "Most
# important pages of 2008."
#
# You can use
# <a href="http://www.sanluis.gov.ar/notas.asp?idCanal=8141&id=22834">
# http://www.sanluis.gov.ar/notas.asp?idCanal=8141&id=22834
# </a>
# instead it seems. Or use "Buscador" from the main page of the San Luis
# government, and fill in "huso" and click OK, and you will get 3 pages
# from which the first one is identical to the above.

# From Mariano Absatz (2008-01-28):
# I can confirm that the Province of San Luis (and so far only that
# province) decided to go back to UTC-3 effective midnight Jan 20th 2008
# (that is, Monday 21st at 0:00 is the time the clocks were delayed back
# 1 hour), and they intend to keep UTC-3 as their timezone all year round
# (that is, unless they change their mind any minute now).
#
# So we'll have to add yet another city to 'southamerica' (I think San
# Luis city is the mos populated city in the Province, so it'd be
# America/Argentina/San_Luis... of course I can't remember if San Luis's
# history of particular changes goes along with Mendoza or San Juan :-(
# (I only remember not being able to collect hard facts about San Luis
# back in 2004, when these provinces changed to UTC-4 for a few days, I
# mailed them personally and never got an answer).

# From Paul Eggert (2008-06-30):
# Unless otherwise specified, data are from Shanks & Pottenger through 1992,
# from the IATA otherwise.  As noted below, Shanks & Pottenger say that
# America/Cordoba split into 6 subregions during 1991/1992, one of which
# was America/San_Luis, but we haven't verified this yet so for now we'll
# keep America/Cordoba a single region rather than splitting it into the
# other 5 subregions.

# From Mariano Absatz (2009-03-13):
# Yesterday (with our usual 2-day notice) the Province of San Luis
# decided that next Sunday instead of "staying" @@utc-03:00 they will go
# to utc-04:00 until the second Saturday in October...
#

# 
# The press release says:

# A partir de entonces, San Luis establecer el huso horario propio de

# (...) announced that next Sunday, at 00:00, Puntanos (the San Luis

# Since then, San Luis will establish its own Province timezone. Thus,

# http://www.mme.gov.br/site/news/detail.do;jsessionid=BBA06811AFCAAC28F0285210913513DA?newsId=13975

# From Paul Schulze (2008-06-24):
# ...by law number 11.662 of April 24, 2008 (published in the "Diario
# Oficial da Uniao"...) in Brazil there are changes in the timezones,
# effective today (00:00am at June 24, 2008) as follows:
#
# a) The timezone UTC+5 is e[x]tinguished, with all the Acre state and the
# part of the Amazonas state that had this timezone now being put to the
# timezone UTC+4
# b) The whole Para state now is put at timezone UTC+3, instead of just
# part of it, as was before.
#
# This change follows a proposal of senator Tiao Viana of Acre state, that
# proposed it due to concerns about open television channels displaying
# programs inappropriate to youths in the states that had the timezone
# UTC+5 too early in the night. In the occasion, some more corrections
# were proposed, trying to unify the timezones of any given state. This
# change modifies timezone rules defined in decree 2.784 of 18 June,
# 1913.

# From Rodrigo Severo (2008-06-24):
# Just correcting the URL:

# </a>
#
# As a result of the above Decree I believe the America/Rio_Branco
# timezone shall be modified from UTC-5 to UTC-4 and a new timezone shall
# be created to represent the the west side of the Para State. I
# suggest this new timezone be called Santarem as the most
# important/populated city in the affected area.
#
# This new timezone would be the same as the Rio_Branco timezone up to
# the 2008/06/24 change which would be to UTC-3 instead of UTC-4.

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-06-24):
# This is a quick reference page for New and Old Brazil Time Zones map.

# - 4 time zones replaced by 3 time zones-eliminating time zone UTC- 05
# (state Acre and the part of the Amazonas will be UTC/GMT- 04) - western

# From Jesper Norgaard Welen (2006-10-08):
# I think that there are some obvious mistakes in the suggested link
# from Oscar van Vlijmen,... for instance entry 66 says that GMT-4
# ended 1990-09-12 while entry 67 only begins GMT-3 at 1990-09-15
# (they should have been 1990-09-15 and 1990-09-16 respectively), but
# anyhow it clears up some doubts too.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-12-27):
# The following data for Chile and America/Santiago are from
# <http://www.horaoficial.cl/horaof.htm> (2006-09-20), transcribed by
# Jesper Norgaard Welen.  The data for Pacific/Easter are from Shanks
# & Pottenger, except with DST transitions after 1932 cloned from
# America/Santiago.  The pre-1980 Pacific/Easter data are dubious,
# but we have no other source.

# From German Poo-Caaman~o (2008-03-03):
# Due to drought, Chile extends Daylight Time in three weeks.  This

# complement of that starting on the 2nd Sunday of March at 0:00 and
# ending on the 2nd Saturday of March at 24:00.
#
# This clearly breaks every time the 1st of March or October is a Sunday.
#
# IMHO, the "spirit of the Law" is to make the changes at 0:00 on the 2nd
# Sunday of October and March.
#
# The problem is that the changes in the rest of the Provinces that did
# change in 2007/2008, were made according to the Federal Law and Decrees
# that did so on the 3rd Sunday of October and March.
#
# In fact, San Luis actually switched from UTC-4 to UTC-3 last Sunday
# (October 11th) at 0:00.
#
# So I guess a new set of rules, besides "Arg", must be made and the last
# America/Argentina/San_Luis entries should change to use these...
#
# I'm enclosing a patch that does what I say... regretfully, the San Luis
# timezone must be called "WART/WARST" even when most of the time (like,
# right now) WARST == ART... that is, since last Sunday, all the country
# is using UTC-3, but in my patch, San Luis calls it "WARST" and the rest
# of the country calls it "ART".

# From Mauricio Parada (2012-02-22), translated by Glenn Eychaner (2012-02-23):
# As stated in the website of the Chilean Energy Ministry
# http://www.minenergia.cl/ministerio/noticias/generales/gobierno-anuncia-fechas-de-cambio-de.html
# The Chilean Government has decided to postpone the entrance into winter time
# (to leave DST) from March 11 2012 to April 28th 2012. The decision has not
# been yet formalized but it will within the next days.
# Quote from the website communication:
#
# 6. For the year 2012, the dates of entry into winter time will be as follows:
# a. Saturday April 28, 2012, clocks should go back 60 minutes; that is, at
# 23:59:59, instead of passing to 0:00, the time should be adjusted to be 23:00
# of the same day.
# b. Saturday, September 1, 2012, clocks should go forward 60 minutes; that is,
# at 23:59:59, instead of passing to 0:00, the time should be adjusted to be
# 01:00 on September 2.
#
# Note that...this is yet another "temporary" change that will be reevaluated
# AGAIN in 2013.

#   The current Atlantic/Stanley entry under South America expects the

#   The database entry states that in 2011 Stanley was staying on fixed

# We've documented similar situations as being plain changes to
# standard time, so let's do that here too.  This does not change UTC
# offsets, only tm_isdst and the time zone abbreviations.  One minor
# plus is that this silences a zic complaint that there's no POSIX TZ
# setting for time stamps past 2038.

#	-- E O Cutler, _New York Times_ (1937-02-14), quoted in
a1100 54
# From Paul Eggert (2015-04-03):
# Shanks & Pottenger says America/Santiago introduced standard time in
# 1890 and rounds its UTC offset to 70W40; guess that in practice this
# was the same offset as in 1916-1919.  It also says Pacific/Easter
# standardized on 109W22 in 1890; assume this didn't change the clocks.
#
# Dates for America/Santiago from 1910 to 2004 are primarily from
# the following source, cited by Oscar van Vlijmen (2006-10-08):
# [1] Chile Law
# http://www.webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/chile.html
# This contains a copy of a this official table:
# Cambios en la hora oficial de Chile desde 1900 (retrieved 2008-03-30)
# http://web.archive.org/web/20080330200901/http://www.horaoficial.cl/cambio.htm
# [1] needs several corrections, though.
#
# The first set of corrections is from:
# [2] History of the Official Time of Chile
# http://www.horaoficial.cl/ing/horaof_ing.html (retrieved 2012-03-06).  See:
# http://web.archive.org/web/20120306042032/http://www.horaoficial.cl/ing/horaof_ing.html
# This is an English translation of:
# Historia de la hora oficial de Chile (retrieved 2012-10-24).  See:
# http://web.archive.org/web/20121024234627/http://www.horaoficial.cl/horaof.htm
# A fancier Spanish version (requiring mouse-clicking) is at:
# http://www.horaoficial.cl/historia_hora.html
# Conflicts between [1] and [2] were resolved as follows:
#
#  - [1] says the 1910 transition was Jan 1, [2] says Jan 10 and cites
#    Boletn N 1, Aviso N 1 (1910).  Go with [2].
#
#  - [1] says SMT was -4:42:45, [2] says Chile's official time from
#    1916 to 1919 was -4:42:46.3, the meridian of Chile's National
#    Astronomical Observatory (OAN), then located in what is now
#    Quinta Normal in Santiago.  Go with [2], rounding it to -4:42:46.
#
#  - [1] says the 1918 transition was Sep 1, [2] says Sep 10 and cites
#    Boletn N 22, Aviso N 129/1918 (1918-08-23).  Go with [2].
#
#  - [1] does not give times for transitions; assume they occur
#    at midnight mainland time, the current common practice.  However,
#    go with [2]'s specification of 23:00 for the 1947-05-21 transition.
#
# Another correction to [1] is from Jesper Nrgaard Welen, who
# wrote (2006-10-08), "I think that there are some obvious mistakes in
# the suggested link from Oscar van Vlijmen,... for instance entry 66
# says that GMT-4 ended 1990-09-12 while entry 67 only begins GMT-3 at
# 1990-09-15 (they should have been 1990-09-15 and 1990-09-16
# respectively), but anyhow it clears up some doubts too."
#
# Data for Pacific/Easter from 1910 through 1967 come from Shanks &
# Pottenger.  After that, for lack of better info assume
# Pacific/Easter is always two hours behind America/Santiago;
# this is known to work for DST transitions starting in 2008 and
# may well be true for earlier transitions.

# From Juan Correa (2016-03-18):
# The decree regarding DST has been published in today's Official Gazette:
# http://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/versiones-anteriores/do/20160318/
# http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=1088502
# It does consider the second Saturday of May and August as the dates
# for the transition; and it lists DST dates until 2019, but I think
# this scheme will stick.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):
# For now, assume the pattern holds for the indefinite future.
# The decree says transitions occur at 24:00; in practice this appears
# to mean 24:00 mainland time, not 24:00 local time, so that Easter
# Island is always two hours behind the mainland.

# The above says the Magallanes change expires 2019-05-11 at 24:00,
# so in theory, they will revert to -04/-03 after that, which means
# they will switch from -03 to -04 one hour after Santiago does that day.
# For now, assume that they will not revert.

# times.  The people called it "hora de Sixto" ("Sixto hour").  The change did
# not go over well; a popular song "Qu hora es" by Jaime Guevara had lyrics
# that included "Amaneca en mitad de la noche, los guaguas iban a clase sin
# sol" ("It was dawning in the middle of the night, the buses went to class
# without sun").  Although Balln's campaign slogan was "Ni un paso atrs"
# (Not one step back), the clocks went back in 1993 and the experiment was not
# repeated.  For now, assume transitions were at 00:00 local time country-wide.

# From Tim Parenti (2018-02-20), per Jeremie Bonjour (2018-01-31) and Michael
# Deckers (2018-02-20):
# ... At least they kept good records...
#
# http://www.armada.mil.uy/ContenidosPDFs/sohma/web/almanaque/almanaque_2018.pdf#page=36
# Page 36 of Almanaque 2018, published by the Oceanography, Hydrography, and
# Meteorology Service of the Uruguayan Navy, seems to give many transitions
# with greater clarity than we've had before.  It directly references many laws
# and decrees which are, in turn, referenced below.  They can be viewed in the
# public archives of the Diario Oficial (in Spanish) at
# http://www.impo.com.uy/diariooficial/
#
# Ley No. 3920 of 1908-06-10 placed the determination of legal time under the
# auspices of the National Institute for the Prediction of Time.  It is unclear
# exactly what offset was used during this period, though Ley No. 7200 of
# 1920-04-23 used the Observatory of the National Meteorological Institute in
# Montevideo (34 54' 33" S, 56 12' 45" W) as its reference meridian,
# retarding legal time by 15 minutes 9 seconds from 1920-04-30 24:00,
# resulting in UT-04.  Assume the corresponding LMT of UT-03:44:51 (given on
# page 725 of the Proceedings of the Second Pan-American Scientific Congress,
# 1915-1916) was in use, and merely became official from 1908-06-10.
# https://www.impo.com.uy/diariooficial/1908/06/18/12
# https://www.impo.com.uy/diariooficial/1920/04/27/9
#
# Ley No. 7594 of 1923-06-28 specified legal time as Observatory time advanced
# by 44 minutes 51 seconds (UT-03) "from 30 September to 31 March", and by 14
# minutes 51 seconds (UT-03:30) "the rest of the year"; a message from the
# National Council of Administration the same day, published directly below the
# law in the Diario Oficial, specified the first transition to be 1923-09-30
# 24:00.  This effectively established standard time at UT-03:30 with 30
# minutes DST.  Assume transitions at 24:00 on the specified days until Ley No.
# 7919 of 1926-03-05 ended this arrangement, repealing all "laws and other
# provisions which oppose" it, resulting in year-round UT-03:30; a Resolucin
# of 1926-03-11 puts the final transition at 1926-03-31 24:00, the same as it
# would have been under the previous law.

# From Tim Parenti (2018-02-15):
# http://www.impo.com.uy/diariooficial/1933/10/27/6
#
# It appears Ley No. 9122 of 1933 was never published as such in the Diario
# Oficial, but instead appeared as Document 26 in the Diario on Friday
# 1933-10-27 as a decree made Monday 1933-10-23 and filed under the Ministry of
# National Defense.  It reinstituted a DST of 30 minutes (to UT-03) "from the
# last Sunday of October...until the last Saturday of March."  In accordance
# with this provision, the first transition was explicitly specified in Article
# 2 of the decree as Saturday 1933-10-28 at 24:00; that is, Sunday 1933-10-29
# at 00:00.  Assume transitions at 00:00 Sunday throughout.
#
# Departing from the matter-of-fact nature of previous timekeeping laws, the
# 1933 decree "consider[s] the advantages of...the advance of legal time":
#
#   "Whereas: The measure adopted by almost all nations at the time of the last
#    World War still persists in North America and Europe, precisely because of
#    the economic, hygienic, and social advantages derived from such an
#    emergency measure...
#
#    Whereas: The advance of the legal time during the summer seasons, by
#    displacing social activity near sunrise, favors the citizen populations
#    and especially the society that creates and works..."
#
# It further specified that "necessary measures" be taken to ensure that

# From Tim Parenti (2018-02-15):
# Most of the Rules below, and their contemporaneous Zone lines, have been
# updated simply to match the Almanaque 2018.  Although the document does not
# list exact transition times, midnight transitions were already present in our
# data here for all transitions through 2004-09, and this is both consistent
# with prior transitions and verified in several decrees marked below between
# 1939-09 and 2004-09, wherein the relevant text was typically of the form:
#
#   "From 0 hours on [date], the legal time of the entire Republic will be...
#
#    In accordance with [the preceding], on [previous date] at 24 hours, all
#    clocks throughout the Republic will be [advanced/retarded] by..."
#
# It is possible that there is greater specificity to be found for the Rules
# below, but it is buried in no fewer than 40 different decrees individually
# referenced by the Almanaque for the period from 1939-09 to 2014-09.
# Four-fifths of these were promulgated less than two weeks before taking
# effect; more than half within a week and none more than 5 weeks.  Only the
# handful with comments below have been checked with any thoroughness.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22): 
# Shanks & Pottenger say that The Bottom and Philipsburg have been at
# -4:00 since standard time was introduced on 1912-03-02; and that
# Kralendijk and Rincon used Kralendijk Mean Time (-4:33:08) from
# 1912-02-02 to 1965-01-01.  The former is dubious, since S&P also say
# Saba Island has been like Curacao.
# This all predates our 1970 cutoff, though.  
#
# By July 2007 Curacao and St Maarten are planned to become
# associated states within the Netherlands, much like Aruba;
# Bonaire, Saba and St Eustatius would become directly part of the
# Netherlands as Kingdom Islands.  This won't affect their time zones
# though, as far as we know.
