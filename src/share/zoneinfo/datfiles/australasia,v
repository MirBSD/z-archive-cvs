# Queensland
#
# From Alex Livingston <alex@@agsm.unsw.edu.au> (1996-11-01):
# I have heard or read more than once that some resort islands off the coast
# of Queensland chose to keep observing daylight-saving time even after
# Queensland ceased to.
#
# From Paul Eggert (1996-11-22):
# IATA SSIM (1993-02/1994-09) say that the Holiday Islands (Hayman, Lindeman,
# Hamilton) observed DST for two years after the rest of Queensland stopped.
# Hamilton is the largest, but there is also a Hamilton in Victoria,
# so use Lindeman.

# Australia

# <a href="http://www.dstc.qut.edu.au/DST/marg/daylight.html">
# Australia's Daylight Saving Times
# </a>, by Margaret Turner, summarizes daylight saving issues in Australia.

# From John Mackin (1991-03-06):
# We in Australia have _never_ referred to DST as `daylight' time.
# It is called `summer' time.  Now by a happy coincidence, `summer'
# and `standard' happen to start with the same letter; hence, the
# abbreviation does _not_ change...
# The legislation does not actually define abbreviations, at least
# in this State, but the abbreviation is just commonly taken to be the
# initials of the phrase, and the legislation here uniformly uses
# the phrase `summer time' and does not use the phrase `daylight
# time'.
# Announcers on the Commonwealth radio network, the ABC (for Australian
# Broadcasting Commission), use the phrases `Eastern Standard Time'
# or `Eastern Summer Time'.  (Note, though, that as I say in the
# current australasia file, there is really no such thing.)  Announcers
# on its overseas service, Radio Australia, use the same phrases
# prefixed by the word `Australian' when referring to local times;
# time announcements on that service, naturally enough, are made in UTC.

# From Arthur David Olson (1992-03-08):
# Given the above, what's chosen for year-round use is:
#	CST	for any place operating at a GMTOFF of 9:30
#	WST	for any place operating at a GMTOFF of 8:00
#	EST	for any place operating at a GMTOFF of 10:00

# From Paul Eggert (2001-04-05), summarizing a long discussion about "EST"
# versus "AEST" etc.:
#
# I see the following points of dispute:
#
# * How important are unique time zone abbreviations?
#
#   Here I tend to agree with the point (most recently made by Chris
#   Newman) that unique abbreviations should not be essential for proper
#   operation of software.  We have other instances of ambiguity
#   (e.g. "IST" denoting both "Israel Standard Time" and "Indian
#   Standard Time"), and they are not likely to go away any time soon.
#   In the old days, some software mistakenly relied on unique
#   abbreviations, but this is becoming less true with time, and I don't
#   think it's that important to cater to such software these days.
#
#   On the other hand, there is another motivation for unambiguous
#   abbreviations: it cuts down on human confusion.  This is
#   particularly true for Australia, where "EST" can mean one thing for
#   time T and a different thing for time T plus 1 second.
#
# * Does the relevant legislation indicate which abbreviations should be used?
#
#   Here I tend to think that things are a mess, just as they are in
#   many other countries.  We Americans are currently disagreeing about
#   which abbreviation to use for the newly legislated Chamorro Standard
#   Time, for example.
#
#   Personally, I would prefer to use common practice; I would like to
#   refer to legislation only for examples of common practice, or as a
#   tiebreaker.
#
# * Do Australians more often use "Eastern Daylight Time" or "Eastern
#   Summer Time"?  Do they typically prefix the time zone names with
#   the word "Australian"?
#
#   My own impression is that both "Daylight Time" and "Summer Time" are
#   common and are widely understood, but that "Summer Time" is more
#   popular; and that the leading "A" is also common but is omitted more
#   often than not.  I just used AltaVista advanced search and got the
#   following count of page hits:
#
#     1,103 "Eastern Summer Time" AND domain:au
#       971 "Australian Eastern Summer Time" AND domain:au
#       613 "Eastern Daylight Time" AND domain:au
#       127 "Australian Eastern Daylight Time" AND domain:au
#
#   Here "Summer" seems quite a bit more popular than "Daylight",
#   particularly when we know the time zone is Australian and not US,
#   say.  The "Australian" prefix seems to be popular for Eastern Summer
#   Time, but unpopular for Eastern Daylight Time.
#
#   For abbreviations, tools like AltaVista are less useful because of
#   ambiguity.  Many hits are not really time zones, unfortunately, and
#   many hits denote US time zones and not Australian ones.  But here
#   are the hit counts anyway:
#
#     161,304 "EST" and domain:au
#      25,156 "EDT" and domain:au
#      18,263 "AEST" and domain:au
#      10,416 "AEDT" and domain:au
#
#      14,538 "CST" and domain:au
#       5,728 "CDT" and domain:au
#         176 "ACST" and domain:au
#          29 "ACDT" and domain:au
#
#       7,539 "WST" and domain:au
#          68 "AWST" and domain:au
#
#   This data suggest that Australians tend to omit the "A" prefix in
#   practice.  The situation for "ST" versus "DT" is less clear, given
#   the ambiguities involved.
#
# * How do Australians feel about the abbreviations in the tz database?
#
#   If you just count Australians on this list, I count 2 in favor and 3
#   against.  One of the "against" votes (David Keegel) counseled delay,
#   saying that both AEST/AEDT and EST/EST are widely used and
#   understood in Australia.

# From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):
# Shanks reports 2:00 for all autumn changes in Australia and New Zealand.
# Mark Prior <mrp@@itd.adelaide.edu.au> writes that his newspaper
# reports that NSW's fall 1995 change will occur at 2:00,
# but Robert Elz says it's been 3:00 in Victoria since 1970
# and perhaps the newspaper's `2:00' is referring to standard time.
# For now we'll continue to assume 2:00s for changes since 1960.

# The chosen rules the union of the 1971/1972 change and the 1989-1992 changes.

# From Rives McDow (2002-04-09):
# The most interesting region I have found consists of three towns on the
# southern coast of Australia, population 10 at last report, along with
# 50,000 sheep, about 100 kilometers long and 40 kilometers into the
# continent.  The primary town is Madura, with the other towns being
# Mundrabilla and Eucla.  According to the sheriff of Madura, the
# residents got tired of having to change the time so often, as they are
# located in a strip overlapping the border of South Australia and Western
# Australia.  South Australia observes daylight saving time; Western
# Australia does not.  The two states are one and a half hours apart.  The
# residents decided to forget about this nonsense of changing the clock so
# much and set the local time 20 hours and 45 minutes from the
# international date line, or right in the middle of the time of South
# Australia and Western Australia.  As it only affects about 10 people and
# tourists staying at the Madura Motel, it has never really made as big an
# impact as Broken Hill.  However, as tourist visiting there or anyone
# calling the local sheriff will attest, they do keep time in this way.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2002-04-09):
# This is confirmed by the section entitled
# "What's the deal with time zones???" in
# <http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/~awatkins/null.html>,
# which says a few other things:
#
# * Border Village, SA also is 45 minutes ahead of Perth.
# * The locals call this time zone "central W.A. Time" (presumably "CWAT").
# * The locals also call Western Australia time "Perth time".
#
# It's not clear from context whether everyone in Western Australia
# knows of this naming convention, or whether it's just the people in
# this subregion.

# South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria

# From Arthur David Olson (1992-03-08):
# The rules from version 7.1 follow.
# There are lots of differences between these rules and
# the Shepherd et al. rules.  Since the Shepherd et al. rules
# and Bradley White's newspaper article are in agreement on
# current DST ending dates, no worries.

# From Scott Harrington (2001-08-29):
# On KQED's "City Arts and Lectures" program last night I heard an
# interesting story about daylight savings time.  Dr. John Heilbron was
# discussing his book "The Sun in the Church: Cathedrals as Solar
# Observatories"[1], and in particular the Shrine of Remembrance[2] located
# in Melbourne, Australia.
#
# Apparently the shrine's main purpose is a beam of sunlight which
# illuminates a special spot on the floor at the 11th hour of the 11th day
# of the 11th month (Remembrance Day) every year in memory of Australia's
# fallen WWI soldiers.  And if you go there on Nov. 11, at 11am local time,
# you will indeed see the sunbeam illuminate the special spot at the
# expected time.
#
# However, that is only because of some special mirror contraption that had
# to be employed, since due to daylight savings time, the true solar time of
# the remembrance moment occurs one hour later (or earlier?).  Perhaps
# someone with more information on this jury-rig can tell us more.

# New South Wales

# From Arthur David Olson:
# New South Wales and subjurisdictions have their own ideas of a fun time.
# Based on law library research by John Mackin (john@@basser.cs.su.oz),
# who notes:
#	In Australia, time is not legislated federally, but rather by the
#	individual states.  Thus, while such terms as ``Eastern Standard Time''
#	[I mean, of course, Australian EST, not any other kind] are in common
#	use, _they have NO REAL MEANING_, as they are not defined in the
#	legislation.  This is very important to understand.

# Lord Howe Island summer time in 2000/2001 will commence on the same
# date as the rest of NSW (i.e. 2000-08-27).  For your information the
# Lord Howe Island Board (controlling authority for the Island) is
# seeking the community's views on various options for summer time
# arrangements on the Island, e.g. advance clocks by 1 full hour
# instead of only 30 minutes.  Dependant on the wishes of residents
# the Board may approach the NSW government to change the existing
# arrangements.  The starting date for summer time on the Island will
# however always coincide with the rest of NSW.

# From James Lonergan, Secretary, Lord Howe Island Board (2000-10-25):
# Lord Howe Island advances clocks by 30 minutes during DST in NSW and retards
# clocks by 30 minutes when DST finishes. Since DST was most recently
# introduced in NSW, the "changeover" time on the Island has been 02:00 as
# shown on clocks on LHI. I guess this means that for 30 minutes at the start
# of DST, LHI is actually 1 hour ahead of the rest of NSW.

# Today's _Wall Street Journal_ (p 1) reports that ``Tonga has been plotting

# Since Kiribati has moved the Date Line it's not clear what Tonga will do.

# Don Mundell writes in the 1997-02-20 Tonga Chronicle
# <a href="http://www.tongatapu.net.to/tonga/homeland/timebegins.htm">
# How Tonga became `The Land where Time Begins'
# </a>:

# Until 1941 Tonga maintained a standard time 50 minutes ahead of NZST
# 12 hours and 20 minutes ahead of GMT.  When New Zealand adjusted its
# standard time in 1940s, Tonga had the choice of subtracting from its
# local time to come on the same standard time as New Zealand or of
# advancing its time to maintain the differential of 13 degrees
# (approximately 50 minutes ahead of New Zealand time).
#
# Because His Majesty King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV, then Crown Prince
# Tungi, preferred to ensure Tonga's title as the land where time
# begins, the Legislative Assembly approved the latter change.
#
# But some of the older, more conservative members from the outer
# islands objected. "If at midnight on Dec. 31, we move ahead 40
# minutes, as your Royal Highness wishes, what becomes of the 40
# minutes we have lost?"
#
# The Crown Prince, presented an unanswerable argument: "Remember that
# on the World Day of Prayer, you would be the first people on Earth
# to say your prayers in the morning."

# From Paul Eggert (1999-08-12):
# Shanks says the transition was on 1968-10-01; go with Mundell.

# From Eric Ulevik (1999-05-03):
# Tonga's director of tourism, who is also secretary of the National Millennium
# Committee, has a plan to get Tonga back in front.
# He has proposed a one-off move to tropical daylight saving for Tonga from
# October to March, which has won approval in principle from the Tongan
# Government.

# From Steffen Thorsen [straen@@thorsen.priv.no] (1999-09-09):

# The International Date Line

# From Gwillim Law (2000-01-03):
#
# The International Date Line is not defined by any international standard,
# convention, or treaty.  Mapmakers are free to draw it as they please.
# Reputable mapmakers will simply ensure that every point of land appears on
# the correct side of the IDL, according to the date legally observed there.
#
# When Kiribati adopted a uniform date in 1995, thereby moving the Phoenix and
# Line Islands to the west side of the IDL (or, if you prefer, moving the IDL
# to the east side of the Phoenix and Line Islands), I suppose that most
# mapmakers redrew the IDL following the boundary of Kiribati.  Even that line
# has a rather arbitrary nature.  The straight-line boundaries between Pacific
# island nations that are shown on many maps are based on an international
# convention, but are not legally binding national borders.
#
# An Anglo-French Conference on Time-Keeping at Sea (June, 1917) agreed that
# legal time on the high seas would be zone time, i.e., the standard time at
# the nearest meridian that is a multiple of fifteen degrees.  The date is
# governed by the IDL; therefore, even on the high seas, there may be some
# places as late as fourteen hours later than UTC.  And, since the IDL is not
# an international standard, there are some places on the high seas where the
# correct date is ambiguous.

# ... it was just on four years ago that I drove along the Eyre Highway,
# which passes through eastern Western Australia close to the southern
# coast of the continent.
#
# I paid particular attention to the time kept there. There can be no
# dispute that UTC+08:45 was considered "the time" from the border
# village just inside the border with South Australia to as far west
# as just east of Caiguna. There can also be no dispute that Eucla is
# the largest population centre in this zone....
#
# Now that Western Australia is observing daylight saving, the
# question arose whether this part of the state would follow suit. I
# just called the border village and confirmed that indeed they have,
# meaning that they are now observing UTC+09:45.
#
# (2006-12-09):
# I personally doubt that either experimentation with daylight saving
# in WA or its introduction in SA had anything to do with the genesis
# of this time zone.  My hunch is that it's been around since well
# before 1975.  I remember seeing it noted on road maps decades ago.

# Before 1920, all ships kept local apparent time on the high seas by setting
# their clocks at night or at the morning sight so that, given the ship's
# speed and direction, it would be 12 o'clock when the Sun crossed the ship's
# meridian (12 o'clock = local apparent noon).  During 1917, at the
# Anglo-French Conference on Time-keeping at Sea, it was recommended that all
# ships, both military and civilian, should adopt hourly standard time zones
# on the high seas.  Whenever a ship was within the territorial waters of any
# nation it would use that nation's standard time.  The captain was permitted
# to change his ship's clocks at a time of his choice following his ship's
# entry into another zone time--he often chose midnight.  These zones were
# adopted by all major fleets between 1920 and 1925 but not by many
# independent merchant ships until World War II.

# I have been in contact with Leilani Tuala Warren from the Samoa Law
# Reform Commission, and she has sent me a copy of the Bill that she
# confirmed has been passed...Most of the sections are about maps rather
# than the time zone change, but I'll paste the relevant bits below. But
# the essence is that at midnight 29 Dec (UTC-11 I suppose), Samoa
# changes from UTC-11 to UTC+13:
#
# International Date Line Bill 2011
#
# AN ACT to provide for the change to standard time in Samoa and to make
# consequential amendments to the position of the International Date
# Line, and for related purposes.
#
# BE IT ENACTED by the Legislative Assembly of Samoa in Parliament
# assembled as follows:
#
# 1. Short title and commencement-(1) This Act may be cited as the
# International Date Line Act 2011. (2) Except for section 5(3) this Act
# commences at 12 o'clock midnight, on Thursday 29th December 2011. (3)
# Section 5(3) commences on the date of assent by the Head of State.
#
# [snip]
#
# 3. Interpretation - [snip] "Samoa standard time" in this Act and any
# other statute of Samoa which refers to 'Samoa standard time' means the
# time 13 hours in advance of Co-ordinated Universal Time.
#
# 4. Samoa standard time - (1) Upon the commencement of this Act, Samoa
# standard time shall be set at 13 hours in advance of Co-ordinated
# Universal Time for the whole of Samoa. (2) All references to Samoa's
# time zone and to Samoa standard time in Samoa in all legislation and

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
# Daylight saving time has long been controversial in Australia, pitting
# region against region, rural against urban, and local against global.
# For example, in her review of Graeme Davison's _The Unforgiving
# Minute: how Australians learned to tell the time_ (1993), Perth native
# Phillipa J Martyr wrote, "The section entitled 'Saving Daylight' was
# very informative, but was (as can, sadly, only be expected from a
# Melbourne-based study) replete with the usual chuckleheaded
# Queenslanders and straw-chewing yokels from the West prattling fables
# about fading curtains and crazed farm animals."

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
#
# Inspired by Mackin's remarks quoted above, earlier versions of this
# file used "EST" for both Eastern Standard Time and Eastern Summer
# Time in Australia, and similarly for "CST", "CWST", and "WST".
# However, these abbreviations were confusing and were not common
# practice among Australians, and there were justifiable complaints
# about them, so I attempted to survey current Australian usage.
# For the tz database, the full English phrase is not that important;
# what matters is the abbreviation.  It's difficult to survey the web
# directly for abbreviation usage, as there are so many false hits for
# strings like "EST" and "EDT", so I looked for pages that defined an
# abbreviation for eastern or central DST in Australia, and got the
# following numbers of unique hits for the listed Google queries:
#
#   10 "Eastern Daylight Time AEST" site:au [some are false hits]
#   10 "Eastern Summer Time AEST" site:au
#   10 "Summer Time AEDT" site:au
#   13 "EDST Eastern Daylight Saving Time" site:au
#   18 "Summer Time ESST" site:au
#   28 "Eastern Daylight Saving Time EDST" site:au
#   39 "EDT Eastern Daylight Time" site:au [some are false hits]
#   53 "Eastern Daylight Time EDT" site:au [some are false hits]
#   54 "AEDT Australian Eastern Daylight Time" site:au
#  182 "Eastern Daylight Time AEDT" site:au
#
#   17 "Central Daylight Time CDT" site:au [some are false hits]
#   46 "Central Daylight Time ACDT" site:au
#
# I tried several other variants (e.g., "Eastern Summer Time EST") but
# they all returned fewer than 10 unique hits.  I also looked for pages
# mentioning both "western standard time" and an abbreviation, since
# there is no WST in the US to generate false hits, and found:
#
#  156 "western standard time" AWST site:au
#  226 "western standard time" WST site:au
#
# I then surveyed the top ten newspapers in Australia by circulation as
# listed in Wikipedia, using Google queries like "AEDT site:heraldsun.com.au"
# and obtaining estimated counts from the initial page of search results.
# All ten papers greatly preferred "AEDT" to "EDT".  The papers
# surveyed were the Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph, The Courier-Mail,
# The Sydney Morning Herald, The West Australian, The Age, The Advertiser,
# The Australian, The Financial Review, and The Herald (Newcastle).
#
# I also searched for historical usage, to see whether abbreviations
# like "AEDT" are new.  A Trove search <http://trove.nla.gov.au/>
# found only one newspaper (The Canberra Times) with a house style
# dating back to the 1970s, I expect because other newspapers weren't
# fully indexed.  The Canberra Times strongly preferred abbreviations
# like "AEDT".  The first occurrence of "AEDT" was a World Weather
# column (1971-11-17, page 24), and of "ACDT" was a Scoreboard column
# (1993-01-24, p 16).  The style was the typical usage but was not
# strictly enforced; for example, "Welcome to the twilight zones ..."
# (1994-10-29, p 1) uses the abbreviations AEST/AEDT, CST/CDT, and
# WST, and goes on to say, "The confusion and frustration some feel
# about the lack of uniformity among Australia's six states and two
# territories has prompted one group to form its very own political
# party -- the Sydney-based Daylight Saving Extension Party."
#
# I also surveyed federal government sources.  They did not agree:

#   EST CST WST preferred for standard time; AEST AEDT ACST ACDT also used
#
#   The Transport Safety Bureau has an extensive series of accident reports,
#   and investigators seem to use whatever abbreviation they like.
#   Googling site:atsb.gov.au found the following number of unique hits:
#   311 "ESuT", 195 "EDT", 26 "AEDT", 83 "CSuT", 46 "CDT".
#   "_SuT" tended to appear in older reports, and "A_DT" tended to
#   appear in reports of events with international implications.
#
# From the above it appears that there is a working consensus in
# Australia to use trailing "DT" for daylight saving time; although
# some sources use trailing "SST" or "ST" or "SuT" they are by far in
# the minority.  The case for leading "A" is weaker, but since it
# seems to be preferred in the overall web and is preferred in all
# the leading newspaper websites and in many government departments,
# it has a stronger case than omitting the leading "A".  The current
# version of the database therefore uses abbreviations like "AEST" and
# "AEDT" for Australian time zones.

# Chatham Island time was formally standardized on 1957-01-01 by
# New Zealand's Standard Time Amendment Act 1956 (1956-10-26).
# http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/legis/hist_act/staa19561956n100244.pdf
# According to Google Books snippet view, a speaker in the New Zealand
# parliamentary debates in 1956 said "Clause 78 makes provision for standard
# time in the Chatham Islands.  The time there is 45 minutes in advance of New
# Zealand time.  I understand that is the time they keep locally, anyhow."
# For now, assume this practice goes back to the introduction of standard time
# in New Zealand, as this would make Chatham Islands time almost exactly match
# LMT back when New Zealand was at UTC+11:30; also, assume Chatham Islands did
# not observe New Zealand's prewar DST.

# From an AP article (1993-08-22):
# "The nearly 3,000 Americans living on this remote Pacific atoll have a good
# excuse for not remembering Saturday night: there wasn't one.  Residents were
# going to bed Friday night and waking up Sunday morning because at midnight
# -- 8 A.M. Eastern daylight time on Saturday -- Kwajalein was jumping from
# one side of the international date line to the other."
# "In Marshall Islands, Friday is followed by Sunday", NY Times. 1993-08-22.
# https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/world/in-marshall-islands-friday-is-followed-by-sunday.html

# From Phake Nick (2018-10-27):
# <https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/南洋群島の標準時> ... pointed out that
# currently tzdata say Pacific/Kwajalein switched from GMT+11 to GMT-12 in
# 1969 October without explanation, however an 1993 article from NYT say it
# synchorized its day with US mainland about 40 years ago and thus the switch
# should occur at around 1950s instead.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-11-18):
# The NYT (actually, AP) article is vague and possibly wrong about this.
# The article says the earlier switch was "40 years ago when the United States
# Army established a missile test range here".  However, the Kwajalein Test
# Center was established on 1960-10-01 and was run by the US Navy.  It was
# transferred to the US Army on 1964-07-01.  See "Seize the High Ground"
# <https://history.army.mil/html/books/070/70-88-1/cmhPub_70-88-1.pdf>.
# Given that Shanks was right on the money about the 1993 change, I'm inclined
# to take Shanks's word for the 1969 change unless we find better evidence.

# ...
# For "Southern Islands" (modern region of Mariana + Palau + Federation of
# Micronesia + Marshall Islands):
#
# A 1906 Japanese magazine shown the Caroline Islands and Mariana Islands
# who was occupied by Germany at the time as GMT+10, together with the like
# of German New Guinea.  However there is a marking saying it have not been
# implemented (yet).  No further information after that were found.
#
# Japan invaded those islands in 1914, and records shows that they were
# instructed to use JST at the time.
#
# 1915 January telecommunication record on the Jaluit Atoll shows they use
# the meridian of 170E as standard time (GMT+11:20), which is similar to the
# longitude of the atoll.
# 1915 February record say the 170E standard time is to be used until
# February 9 noon, and after February 9 noon they are to use JST.
# However these are time used within the Japanese Military at the time and
# probably does not reflect the time used by local resident at the time (that
# is if they keep their own time back then)
#
# In January 1919 the occupying force issued a command that split the area
# into three different timezone with meridian of 135E, 150E, 165E (JST+0, +1,
# +2), and the command was to become effective from February 1 of the same
# year.  Despite the target of the command is still only for the occupying
# force itself, further publication have described the time as the standard
# time for the occupied area and thus it can probably be seen as such.
#  * Area that use meridian of 135E: Palau and Yap civil administration area
#    (Southern Islands Western Standard Time)
#  * Area that use meridian of 150E: Truk (Chuuk) and Saipan civil
#    administration area (Southern Islands Central Standard Time)
#  * Area that use meridian of 165E: Ponape (Pohnpei) and Jaluit civil
#    administration area (Southern Islands Eastern Standard Time).
#  * In the next few years Japanese occupation of those islands have been
#    formalized via League of Nation Mandate (South Pacific Mandate) and formal
#    governance structure have been established, these district [become
#    subprefectures] and timezone classification have been inherited as standard
#    time of the area.
#  * Saipan subprefecture include Mariana islands (exclude Guam which was
#    occupied by America at the time), Palau and Yap subprefecture rule the
#    Western Caroline Islands with 137E longitude as border, Truk and Ponape
#    subprefecture rule the Eastern Caroline Islands with 154E as border, Ponape
#    subprefecture also rule part of Marshall Islands to the west of 164E
#    starting from (1918?) and Jaluit subprefecture rule the rest of the
#    Marshall Islands.
#
# And then in year 1937, an announcement was made to change the time in the
# area into 2 timezones:
#  * Area that use meridian of 135E: area administered by Palau, Yap and
#    Saipan subprefecture (Southern Islands Western Standard Time)
#  * Area that use meridian of 150E: area administered by Truk (Chuuk),
#    Ponape (Pohnpei) and Jaluit subprefecture (Southern Islands Eastern
#    Standard Time)
#
# Another announcement issued in 1941 say that on April 1 that year,
# standard time of the Southern Islands would be changed to use the meridian
# of 135E (GMT+9), and thus abolishing timezone different within the area.
#
# Then Pacific theater of WWII started and Japan slowly lose control on the
# island.  The webpage I linked above contain no information during this
# period of time....
#
# After the end of WWII, in 1946 February, a document written by the
# (former?) Japanese military personnel describe there are 3 hours time
# different between Caroline islands time/Wake island time and the Chungking
# time, which would mean the time being used there at the time was GMT+10.
#
# After that, the area become Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands
# under American administration from year 1947.  The site listed some
# American/International books/maps/publications about time used in those
# area during this period of time but they doesn't seems to be reliable
# information so it would be the best if someone know where can more reliable
# information can be found.
#
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-11-18):
#
# For the above, use vague dates like "1914" and "1945" for transitions that
# plausibly exist but for which the details are not known.  The information
# for Wake is too sketchy to act on.
#
# The 1906 GMT+10 info about German-controlled islands might not have been
# done, so omit it from the data for now.
#
# The Jaluit info governs Kwajalein.

# Nauru

# From Phake Nick (2018-10-31):
# Currently, the tz database say Nauru use LMT until 1921, and then
# switched to GMT+11:30 for the next two decades.
# However, a number of timezone map published in America/Japan back then
# showed its timezone as GMT+11 per https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/ナウルの標準時
# And it would also be nice if the 1921 transition date could be sourced.
# ...
# The "Nauru Standard Time Act 1978 Time Change"
# http://ronlaw.gov.nr/nauru_lpms/files/gazettes/4b23a17d2030150404db7a5fa5872f52.pdf#page=3
# based on "Nauru Standard Time Act 1978 Time Change"
# http://www.paclii.org/nr/legis/num_act/nsta1978207/ defined that "Nauru
# Alternative Time" (GMT+12) should be in effect from 1979 Feb.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-11-19):
# The 1921-01-15 introduction of standard time is in Shanks; it is also in
# "Standard Time Throughout the World", US National Bureau of Standards (1935),
# page 3, which does not give the UT offset.  In response to a comment by
# Phake Nick I set the Nauru time of occupation by Japan to
# 1942-08-29/1945-09-08 by using dates from:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Nauru

# ... include[s] a rough description of the geographical boundaries...
# "The time zone exists for about 340 kilometres and takes in the tiny

# ... and an indication that the zone has definitely been in existence
# since before the 1970 cut-off of the database ...
# From Paul Eggert (2019-05-17):

# Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands and Marcus Island (Minami-Tori-shima)

# From Wakaba (2019-01-28) via Phake Nick:
# National Diet Library of Japan has several reports by Japanese Government
# officers that describe the time used in islands when they visited there.
# According to them (and other sources such as newspapers), standard time UTC
# + 10 (JST + 1) and DST UTC + 11 (JST + 2) was used until its return to Japan
# at 1968-06-26 00:00 JST.  The exact periods of DST are still unknown.
# I guessed Guam, Mariana, and Bonin and Marcus districts might have
# synchronized their DST periods, but reports imply they had their own
# decisions, i.e. there were three or more different time zones....
#
# https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/小笠原諸島の標準時

# From Phake Nick (2019-02-12):
# Because their last time change to return to Japanese time when they returned
# to Japanese rule was right before 1970, ... per the current tz database
# rule, the information doesn't warrant creation of a new timezone for Bonin
# Islands itself and is thus as an anecdotal note for interest purpose only.
# ... [The abovementioned link] described some special timekeeping phenomenon
# regarding Marcus island, another remote island currently owned by Japanese
# in the same administrative unit as Bonin Islands.  Many reports claim that
# the American coastal guard on the American quarter of the island use its own
# coastal guard time, and most sources describe the time as UTC+11, being two
# hours faster than JST used by some Japanese personnel on the island.  Some
# sites describe it as same as Wake Island/Guam time although it would be
# incorrect to be same as Guam.  And then in a few Japanese governmental
# report from 1980s (from National Institute of Information and Communications
# Technology) regarding the construction of VLBI facility on the Marcus
# Island, it claimed that there are three time standards being used on the
# island at the time which include not just JST (UTC+9) or [US]CG time
# (UTC+11) but also a JMSDF time (UTC+10) (Japan Maritime Self-Defense
# Force).  Unfortunately there are no other sources that mentioned such time
# and there are also no information on things like how the time was used.

# From Alex Livingston (2006-12-07):
# ... it was just on four years ago that I drove along the Eyre Highway,
# which passes through eastern Western Australia close to the southern
# coast of the continent.
#
# I paid particular attention to the time kept there. There can be no
# dispute that UTC+08:45 was considered "the time" from the border
# village just inside the border with South Australia to as far west
# as just east of Caiguna. There can also be no dispute that Eucla is
# the largest population centre in this zone....
#
# Now that Western Australia is observing daylight saving, the
# question arose whether this part of the state would follow suit. I
# just called the border village and confirmed that indeed they have,
# meaning that they are now observing UTC+09:45.
# 
# (2006-12-09):
# I personally doubt that either experimentation with daylight saving
# in WA or its introduction in SA had anything to do with the genesis
# of this time zone.  My hunch is that it's been around since well
# before 1975.  I remember seeing it noted on road maps decades ago.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-12-15):
# For lack of better info, assume the tradition dates back to the

# From Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone> (2005-08-31):
# Before 1920, all ships kept local apparent time on the high seas by setting
# their clocks at night or at the morning sight so that, given the ship's
# speed and direction, it would be 12 o'clock when the Sun crossed the ship's
# meridian (12 o'clock = local apparent noon).  During 1917, at the
# Anglo-French Conference on Time-keeping at Sea, it was recommended that all
# ships, both military and civilian, should adopt hourly standard time zones
# on the high seas.  Whenever a ship was within the territorial waters of any
# nation it would use that nation's standard time.  The captain was permitted
# to change his ship's clocks at a time of his choice following his ship's
# entry into another zone time--he often chose midnight.  These zones were
# adopted by all major fleets between 1920 and 1925 but not by many
# independent merchant ships until World War II.
