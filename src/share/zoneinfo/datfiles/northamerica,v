# This data is by no means authoritative; if you think you know better,
# go ahead and edit the file (and please send any changes to
# tz@@elsie.nci.nih.gov for general use in the future).

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@@twinsun.com> (1999-03-22):
# A reliable and entertaining source about time zones is
# Derek Howse, Greenwich time and longitude, Philip Wilson Publishers (1997).

###############################################################################

# United States

# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):
# Howse writes (pp 121-125) that time zones were invented by
# Professor Charles Ferdinand Dowd (1825-1904),
# Principal of Temple Grove Ladies' Seminary (Saratoga Springs, NY).
# His pamphlet ``A System of National Time for Railroads'' (1870)
# was the result of his proposals at the Convention of Railroad Trunk Lines
# in New York City (1869-10).  His 1870 proposal was based on Washington, DC,
# but in 1872-05 he moved the proposed origin to Greenwich.
# His proposal was adopted by the railroads on 1883-11-18 at 12:00,
# and the most of the country soon followed suit.

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@@twinsun.com> (1995-12-19):
# A good source for time zone historical data in the US is
# Thomas G. Shanks, The American Atlas (5th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1991).
# Make sure you have the errata sheet; the book is somewhat useless without it.
# It is the source for the US and Puerto Rico entries below.

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
# Daylight Saving Time was first suggested as a joke by Benjamin Franklin
# in his whimsical essay ``An Economical Project for Diminishing the Cost
# of Light'' published in the Journal de Paris (1784-04-26).
# Not everyone is happy with the results:
#
#	I don't really care how time is reckoned so long as there is some
#	agreement about it, but I object to being told that I am saving
#	daylight when my reason tells me that I am doing nothing of the kind.
#	I even object to the implication that I am wasting something
#	valuable if I stay in bed after the sun has risen.  As an admirer
#	of moonlight I resent the bossy insistence of those who want to
#	reduce my time for enjoying it.  At the back of the Daylight Saving
#	scheme I detect the bony, blue-fingered hand of Puritanism, eager
#	to push people into bed earlier, and get them up earlier, to make
#	them healthy, wealthy and wise in spite of themselves.
#
#	-- Robertson Davies, The Diary of Samuel Marchbanks (1947), XIX, Sunday
#
# For more about the first ten years of DST in the United States, see
# Robert Garland's <a href="http://www.clpgh.org/exhibit/dst.html">
# Ten years of daylight saving from the Pittsburgh standpoint
# (Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, 1927)</a>.
#
# Shanks says that DST was called "War Time" in the US in 1918 and 1919.
# However, DST was imposed by the Standard Time Act of 1918, which
# was the first nationwide legal time standard, and apparently
# time was just called "Standard Time" or "Daylight Saving Time".

# From Arthur David Olson:
# US Daylight Saving Time ended on the last Sunday of *October* in 1974.
# See, for example, the front page of the Saturday, 1974-10-26
# and Sunday, 1974-10-27 editions of the Washington Post.

# From Arthur David Olson:
# Before the Uniform Time Act of 1966 took effect in 1967, observance of
# Daylight Saving Time in the US was by local option, except during wartime.

# From Arthur David Olson (2000-09-25):
# Last night I heard part of a rebroadcast of a 1945 Arch Oboler radio drama.
# In the introduction, Oboler spoke of "Eastern Peace Time."
# An AltaVista search turned up
# <a href="http://rowayton.org/rhs/hstaug45.html">:
# "When the time is announced over the radio now, it is 'Eastern Peace
# Time' instead of the old familiar 'Eastern War Time.'  Peace is wonderful."
# </a> (August 1945) by way of confirmation.

# From Joseph Gallant <notquite@@hotmail.com>, citing
# George H. Douglas, _The Early Days of Radio Broadcasting_ (1987):
# At 7 P.M. (Eastern War Time) [on 1945-08-14], the networks were set
# to switch to London for Attlee's address, but the American people
# never got to hear his speech live. According to one press account,
# CBS' Bob Trout was first to announce the word of Japan's surrender,
# but a few seconds later, NBC, ABC and Mutual also flashed the word
# of surrender, all of whom interrupting the bells of Big Ben in
# London which were to precede Mr. Attlee's speech.

# From Paul Eggert (2003-02-09): It was Robert St John, not Bob Trout.  From
# Myrna Oliver's obituary of St John on page B16 of today's Los Angeles Times:
#
# ... a war-weary U.S. clung to radios, awaiting word of Japan's surrender.
# Any announcement from Asia would reach St. John's New York newsroom on a
# wire service teletype machine, which had prescribed signals for major news.
# Associated Press, for example, would ring five bells before spewing out
# typed copy of an important story, and 10 bells for news "of transcendental
# importance."
#
# On Aug. 14, stalling while talking steadily into the NBC networks' open
# microphone, St. John heard five bells and waited only to hear a sixth bell,
# before announcing confidently: "Ladies and gentlemen, World War II is over.
# The Japanese have agreed to our surrender terms."
#
# He had scored a 20-second scoop on other broadcasters.

# ...Alaska's timezone lines were redrawn in 1983 to give only 2 tz.
#    The YST zone now covers nearly all of the state, AHST just part
#    of the Aleutian islands.   No DST.

# From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):
# The tables below use `NST', not `NT', for Nome Standard Time.

# From Arthur David Olson (1988-02-13):
# Legal standard time zone names, from United States Code (1982 Edition and
# Supplement III), Title 15, Chapter 6, Section 260 and forward.  First, names

#	United States standard eastern time
#	United States standard mountain time
#	United States standard central time
#	United States standard Pacific time
#	(none)
#	United States standard Alaska time

# Next, names from 1967-04-01 until 1983-11-30 (the date for
# public law 98-181):
#	Atlantic standard time
#	eastern standard time
#	central standard time
#	mountain standard time
#	Pacific standard time
#	Yukon standard time
#	Alaska-Hawaii standard time
#	Bering standard time
# And after 1983-11-30:
#	Atlantic standard time
#	eastern standard time
#	central standard time
#	mountain standard time
#	Pacific standard time
#	Alaska standard time
#	Hawaii-Aleutian standard time
#	Samoa standard time
# The law doesn't give abbreviations.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2000-01-08), following a heads-up from Rives McDow:
# Public law 106-564 (2000-12-23) introduced the abbreviation
# "Chamorro Standard Time" for time in Guam and the Northern Marianas.

# Alaska
# AK%sT is the modern abbreviation for -9:00 per USNO.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-05-30):
# Howse writes that Alaska switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar,
# and from east-of-GMT to west-of-GMT days, when the US bought it from Russia.
# This was on 1867-10-18, a Friday; the previous day was 1867-10-06 Julian,
# also a Friday.  Include only the time zone part of this transition,
# ignoring the switch from Julian to Gregorian, since we can't represent
# the Julian calendar.
#
# As far as we know, none of the exact locations mentioned below were
# permanently inhabited in 1867 by anyone using either calendar.
# (Yakutat was colonized by the Russians in 1799, but the settlement

# Now we turn to US areas that have diverged from the consensus since 1970.

# Arizona mostly uses MST.

# From Paul Eggert (2002-10-20):
#
# The information in the rest of this paragraph is derived from the
# <a href="http://www.dlapr.lib.az.us/links/daylight.htm">
# Daylight Saving Time web page (2002-01-23)</a> maintained by the
# Arizona State Library, Archives and Public Records.
# Between 1944-01-01 and 1944-04-01 the State of Arizona used standard
# time, but by federal law railroads, airlines, bus lines, military
# personnel, and some engaged in interstate commerce continued to
# observe war (i.e., daylight saving) time.  The 1944-03-17 Phoenix
# Gazette says that was the date the law changed, and that 04-01 was
# the date the state's clocks would change.  In 1945 the State of
# Arizona used standard time all year, again with exceptions only as
# mandated by federal law.  Arizona observed DST in 1967, but Arizona
# Laws 1968, ch. 183 (effective 1968-03-21) repealed DST.
#
# Shanks says the 1944 experiment came to an end on 1944-03-17.
# Go with the Arizona State Library instead.

# Indiana
#
# For a map of Indiana's time zone regions, see:
# <a href="http://www.mccsc.edu/time.html">
# What time is it in Indiana?
# </a> (1999-04-06)
#
# From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):
# Indiana generally observes either EST all year, or CST/CDT,
# but areas near Cincinnati and Louisville use those cities' timekeeping
# and in 1969 and 1970 the whole state observed daylight time;
# and there are other exceptions as noted below.
# Shanks partitions Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
# and writes ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''
# Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
#
# Since 1970, EST-only Indiana has been like America/Indianapolis,
# with exceptions noted below for Crawford, Starke, and Switzerland counties.
# The parts of Indiana not listed below have been like America/Chicago,
# America/Louisville, or America/New_York.
#
# Other than Indianapolis, the Indiana place names are so nondescript
# that they would be ambiguous if we left them at the `America' level.
# So we reluctantly put them all in a subdirectory `America/Indiana'.
#
# Most of EST-only Indiana last observed DST in 1970.

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06), following a tip by Markus Kuhn:
# Pam Belluck reported in the New York Times (2001-01-31) that the
# Indiana Legislature is considering a bill to adopt DST statewide.
# Her article mentioned Vevay, whose post office observes a different
# time zone from Danner's Hardware across the street.

# Lake Cumberland LIFE
# </a> (1999-01-29) via WKYM-101.7:
# Clinton County has joined Wayne County in asking the DoT to change from
# the Central to the Eastern time zone....  The Wayne County government made
# the same request in December.  And while Russell County officials have not
# taken action, the majority of respondents to a poll conducted there in
# August indicated they would like to change to "fast time" also.
# The three Lake Cumberland counties are the farthest east of any U.S.
# location in the Central time zone.
#
# From Rich Wales (2000-08-29):
# After prolonged debate, and despite continuing deep differences of opinion,
# Wayne County (central Kentucky) is switching from Central (-0600) to Eastern
# (-0500) time.  They won't "fall back" this year.  See Sara Shipley,
# The difference an hour makes, Nando Times (2000-08-29 15:33 -0400).

# From Paul Eggert (2001-07-16):

# From Paul Eggert (2001-07-17):
# We don't know where the line used to be within Kearny County, KS,

# See America/Indiana/Knox for the Starke County, IN change.
# See America/North_Dakota/Center for the Oliver County, ND change.

# However, the Federal Register says that West Wendover already operated

# hence a separate tz entry is not needed.

# Michigan
#
# From Bob Devine (1988-01-28):
# Michigan didn't observe DST from 1968 to 1973.
#
# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):
# Shanks writes that Michigan started using standard time on 1885-09-18,
# but Howse writes (pp 124-125, referring to Popular Astronomy, 1901-01)
# that Detroit kept
#
#	local time until 1900 when the City Council decreed that clocks should
#	be put back twenty-eight minutes to Central Standard Time.  Half the
#	city obeyed, half refused.  After considerable debate, the decision
#	was rescinded and the city reverted to Sun time.  A derisive offer to
#	erect a sundial in front of the city hall was referred to the
#	Committee on Sewers.  Then, in 1905, Central time was adopted
#	by city vote.
#
# This story is too entertaining to be false, so go with Howse over Shanks.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
# Garland (1927) writes ``Cleveland and Detroit advanced their clocks
# one hour in 1914.''  This change is not in Shanks.  We have no more
# info, so omit this for now.
#
# Most of Michigan observed DST from 1973 on, but was a bit late in 1975.

# Ontario, Quebec

# From Paul Eggert (1996-06-12):
# Shanks writes that since 1970 most of Ontario has been like Toronto,
# and most of Quebec has been like Montreal.
# Thunder Bay skipped DST in 1973.
# Many smaller locales did not observe peacetime DST until 1974;
# Nipigon (EST) and Rainy River (CST) are the largest that we know of.
# Far west Ontario is like Winnipeg; far east Quebec is like Halifax.

# From Mark Brader (2003-07-26):
# [According to the Toronto Star] Orillia, Ontario, adopted DST
# effective Saturday, 1912-06-22, 22:00; the article mentions that
# Port Arthur (now part of Thunder Bay, Ontario) as well as Moose Jaw
# have already done so.  In Orillia DST was to run until Saturday,
# 1912-08-31 (no time mentioned), but it was met with considerable
# hostility from certain segments of the public, and was revoked after
# only two weeks -- I copied it as Saturday, 1912-07-07, 22:00, but
# presumably that should be -07-06.  (1912-06-19, -07-12; also letters
# earlier in June).
#
# Kenora, Ontario, was to abandon DST on 1914-06-01 (-05-21).

# From Paul Eggert (1997-10-17):
# Mark Brader writes that an article in the 1997-10-14 Toronto Star
# says that Atikokan, Ontario currently does not observe DST,
# but will vote on 11-10 whether to use EST/EDT.
# He also writes that the
# <a href="http://www.gov.on.ca/MBS/english/publications/statregs/conttext.html">
# Ontario Time Act (1990, Chapter T.9)
# </a>
# says that Ontario east of 90W uses EST/EDT, and west of 90W uses CST/CDT.
# Officially Atikokan is therefore on CST/CDT, and most likely this report
# concerns a non-official time observed as a matter of local practice.
# For what it's worth, Shanks says that Atikokan has agreed with
# Rainy River ever since standard time was introduced.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Atikokan, Pickle Lake, and
# New Osnaburgh observe CST all year, that Big Trout Lake observes
# CST/CDT, and that Upsala and Shebandowan observe EST/EDT, all in
# violation of the official Ontario rules.
# They also write that Quebec east of the -63 meridian is supposed to
# observe AST, but residents as far east as Natashquan use EST/EDT,
# and residents east of Natashquan use AST.
# We probably need Zones for far east Quebec and for Atikokan,
# but we don't know when their practices started.

# From David Bryan via Tory Tronrud, Director/Curator,

# There is some suggestion, however, that, by-law or not, daylight
# savings time was being practiced in Fort William and Port Arthur
# before 1909.... [I]n 1910, the line between the Eastern and Central
# Time Zones was permanently moved about two hundred miles west to
# include the Thunder Bay area....  When Canada adopted daylight
# savings time in 1916, Fort William and Port Arthur, having done so
# already, did not change their clocks....  During the Second World
# War,... [t]he cities agreed to implement DST during the summer
# months for the remainder of the war years.

# Saskatchewan

# From Mark Brader (2003-07-26):
# The first actual adoption of DST in Canada was at the municipal
# level.  As the [Toronto] Star put it (1912-06-07), "While people
# elsewhere have long been talking of legislation to save daylight,
# the city of Moose Jaw [Saskatchewan] has acted on its own hook."
# DST in Moose Jaw began on Saturday, 1912-06-01 (no time mentioned:
# presumably late evening, as below), and would run until "the end of
# the summer".  The discrepancy between municipal time and railroad
# time was noted.

# From Paul Eggert (2003-07-27):
# Willett (1914-03) notes that DST "has been in operation ... in the
# City of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, for one year."

# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
# Shanks writes that since 1970 most of this region has been like Regina.
# Some western towns (e.g. Swift Current) switched from MST/MDT to CST in 1972.
# Other western towns (e.g. Lloydminster) are like Edmonton.
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Denare Beach and Creighton
# are like Winnipeg, in violation of Saskatchewan law.

# From W. Jones <jones@@skdad.usask.ca> (1992-11-06):
# The. . .below is based on information I got from our law library, the
# provincial archives, and the provincial Community Services department.
# A precise history would require digging through newspaper archives, and
# since you didn't say what you wanted, I didn't bother.
#
# Saskatchewan is split by a time zone meridian (105W) and over the years
# the boundary became pretty ragged as communities near it reevaluated
# their affiliations in one direction or the other.  In 1965 a provincial
# referendum favoured legislating common time practices.
#
# On 15 April 1966 the Time Act (c. T-14, Revised Statutes of
# Saskatchewan 1978) was proclaimed, and established that the eastern
# part of Saskatchewan would use CST year round, that districts in
# northwest Saskatchewan would by default follow CST but could opt to
# follow Mountain Time rules (thus 1 hour difference in the winter and
# zero in the summer), and that districts in southwest Saskatchewan would
# by default follow MT but could opt to follow CST.
#
# It took a few years for the dust to settle (I know one story of a town
# on one time zone having its school in another, such that a mom had to
# serve her family lunch in two shifts), but presently it seems that only
# a few towns on the border with Alberta (e.g. Lloydminster) follow MT
# rules any more; all other districts appear to have used CST year round
# since sometime in the 1960s.

# Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Yukon

# From Paul Eggert (1999-10-29):
# Dawson switched to PST in 1973.  Inuvik switched to MST in 1979.
# Mathew Englander <mathew@@io.org> (1996-10-07) gives the following refs:
#	* 1967. Paragraph 28(34)(g) of the Interpretation Act, S.C. 1967-68,
#	c. 7 defines Yukon standard time as UTC-9.  This is still valid;
#	see Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, s. 35(1).
#	* C.O. 1973/214 switched Yukon to PST on 1973-10-28 00:00.
#	* O.I.C. 1980/02 established DST.
#	* O.I.C. 1987/056 changed DST to Apr firstSun 2:00 to Oct lastSun 2:00.
# Shanks says Yukon's 1973-10-28 switch was at 2:00; go with Englander.

# From Rives McDow (1999-09-04):

# </a>
#
# From Antoine Leca (1999-09-06):
# We then need to create a new timezone for the Kitikmeot region of Nunavut
# to differentiate it from the Yellowknife region.

# From Paul Eggert (1999-09-20):
# <a href="http://www.nunavut.com/basicfacts/english/basicfacts_1territory.html">
# Basic Facts: The New Territory
# </a> (1999) reports that Pangnirtung operates on eastern time,
# and that Coral Harbour does not observe DST.  We don't know when
# Pangnirtung switched to eastern time; we'll guess 1995.
# We'll ignore the claim about Coral Harbour for now,
# since we have no further info.

# From Rives McDow (1999-11-08):
# On October 31, when the rest of Nunavut went to Central time,
# Pangnirtung wobbled.  Here is the result of their wobble:
#
# The following businesses and organizations in Pangnirtung use Central Time:
#
#	First Air, Power Corp, Nunavut Construction, Health Center, RCMP,
#	Eastern Arctic National Parks, A & D Specialist
#
# The following businesses and organizations in Pangnirtung use Eastern Time:
#
#	Hamlet office, All other businesses, Both schools, Airport operator
#
# This has made for an interesting situation there, which warranted the news.
# No one there that I spoke with seems concerned, or has plans to
# change the local methods of keeping time, as it evidently does not
# really interfere with any activities or make things difficult locally.
# They plan to celebrate New Year's turn-over twice, one hour apart,
# so it appears that the situation will last at least that long.
# The Nunavut Intergovernmental Affairs hopes that they will "come to
# their senses", but the locals evidently don't see any problem with
# the current state of affairs.

# Nunatsiaq News (1999-11-19)</a>:
# Clyde River, Pangnirtung and Sanikiluaq now operate with two time zones,
# central - or Nunavut time - for government offices, and eastern time
# for municipal offices and schools....  Igloolik [was similar but then]
# made the switch to central time on Saturday, Nov. 6.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) say the following, but we lack histories
# for these potential new Zones.
#
# The Canadian Forces station at Alert uses Eastern Time while the
# handful of residents at the Eureka weather station [in the Central

# Central, Eastern and Atlantic Time zones only uses Eastern Time.
# Gjoa Haven, Taloyoak and Pelly Bay all use Mountain instead of
# Central Time and Southampton Island [in the Central zone] is not
# required to use daylight savings.

# Nunavut now has two time zones
# </a> (2000-11-10):
# The Nunavut government would allow its employees in Kugluktuk and
# Cambridge Bay to operate on central time year-round, putting them
# one hour behind the rest of Nunavut for six months during the winter.
# At the end of October the two communities had rebelled against

# From Rives McDow (2001-03-07):
# The premier of Nunavut has issued a ministerial statement advising
# that effective 2001-04-01, the territory of Nunavut will revert

# Mexico

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-05):
# The Investigation and Analysis Service of the
# Mexican Library of Congress (MLoC) has published a
# <a href="http://www.cddhcu.gob.mx/bibliot/publica/inveyana/polisoc/horver/">
# history of Mexican local time (in Spanish)
# </a>.
#
# Here are the discrepancies between Shanks and the MLoC.
# (In all cases we go with the MLoC.)
# Shanks reports that Baja was at -8:00 in 1922/1923.
# Shanks says the 1930 transition in Baja was 1930-11-16.
# Shanks reports no DST during summer 1931.
# Shanks reports a transition at 1032-03-30 23:00, not 1932-04-01.
# Shanks does not report transitions for Baja in 1945 or 1948.
# Shanks reports southern Mexico transitions on 1981-12-01, not 12-23.
# Shanks says Quintana Roo switched to -6:00 on 1982-12-02, and to -5:00
# on 1997-10-26 at 02:00.

# From Gwillim Law (2001-02-20):
# There are some other discrepancies between the Decrees page and the
# tz database.  I think they can best be explained by supposing that
# the researchers who prepared the Decrees page failed to find some of
# the relevant documents.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-07-26):
# Shanks gives 1942-04-01 instead of 1942-04-24, and omits the 1981
# and 1988 DST experiments.  Go with spin.com.mx.

# From Alan Perry <alan.perry@@eng.sun.com> (1996-02-15):
# A guy from our Mexico subsidiary finally found the Presidential Decree
# outlining the timezone changes in Mexico.
#
# ------------- Begin Forwarded Message -------------
#
# I finally got my hands on the Official Presidential Decree that sets up the
# rules for the DST changes. The rules are:
#
# 1. The country is divided in 3 timezones:
#    - Baja California Norte (the Mexico/BajaNorte TZ)
#    - Baja California Sur, Nayarit, Sinaloa and Sonora (the Mexico/BajaSur TZ)
#    - The rest of the country (the Mexico/General TZ)
#
# 2. From the first Sunday in April at 2:00 AM to the last Sunday in October
#    at 2:00 AM, the times in each zone are as follows:
#    BajaNorte: GMT+7
#    BajaSur:   GMT+6
#    General:   GMT+5
#
# 3. The rest of the year, the times are as follows:
#    BajaNorte: GMT+8
#    BajaSur:   GMT+7
#    General:   GMT+6
#
# The Decree was published in Mexico's Official Newspaper on January 4th.

# The State of Quintana Roo has reverted back to central STD and DST times
# (i.e. UTC -0600 and -0500 as of 1998-08-02).

# From Rives McDow (2000-01-10):
# Effective April 4, 1999 at 2:00 AM local time, Sonora changed to the time
# zone 5 hours from the International Date Line, and will not observe daylight
# savings time so as to stay on the same time zone as the southern part of
# Arizona year round.

# From Jesper Norgaard, translating
# <http://www.reforma.com/nacional/articulo/064327/> (2001-01-17):
# In Oaxaca, the 55.000 teachers from the Section 22 of the National
# Syndicate of Education Workers, refuse to apply daylight saving each
# year, so that the more than 10,000 schools work at normal hour the
# whole year.

# <http://www.reforma.com/negocios_y_dinero/articulo/064481/> ... says

# in May, and end on the last Sunday of September.

# From Arthur David Olson (2001-01-25):
# The 2001-01-24 traditional Washington Post contained the page one
# story "Timely Issue Divides Mexicans."...
# http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A37383-2001Jan23.html
# ... Mexico City Mayor Lopez Obrador "...is threatening to keep
# Mexico City and its 20 million residents on a different time than
# the rest of the country..." In particular, Lopez Obrador would abolish
# observation of Daylight Saving Time.

# <a href="http://www.conae.gob.mx/ahorro/decretohorver2001.html#decre">
# Official statute published by the Energy Department
# </a> (2001-02-01) shows Baja and Chihauhua as still using US DST rules,
# and Sonora with no DST.  This was reported by Jesper Norgaard (2001-02-03).

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-03):
#
# <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/20010303/t000018766.html">
# James F. Smith writes in today's LA Times
# </a>
# * Sonora will continue to observe standard time.
# * Last week Mexico City's mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador decreed that
#   the Federal District will not adopt DST.
# * 4 of 16 district leaders announced they'll ignore the decree.
# * The decree does not affect federal-controlled facilities including
#   the airport, banks, hospitals, and schools.
#
# For now we'll assume that the Federal District will bow to federal rules.

# From Jesper Norgaard (2001-04-01):
# I found some references to the Mexican application of daylight
# saving, which modifies what I had already sent you, stating earlier
# that a number of northern Mexican states would go on daylight
# saving. The modification reverts this to only cover Baja California
# (Norte), while all other states (except Sonora, who has no daylight
# saving all year) will follow the original decree of president
# Vicente Fox, starting daylight saving May 6, 2001 and ending
# September 30, 2001.

# From Reuters (2001-09-04):
# Mexico's Supreme Court on Tuesday declared that daylight savings was
# unconstitutional in Mexico City, creating the possibility the
# capital will be in a different time zone from the rest of the nation
# next year....  The Supreme Court's ruling takes effect at 2:00
# a.m. (0800 GMT) on Sept. 30, when Mexico is scheduled to revert to
# standard time. "This is so residents of the Federal District are not
# subject to unexpected time changes," a statement from the court said.

# From Jesper Norgaard Welen (2002-03-12):
# ... consulting my local grocery store(!) and my coworkers, they all insisted
# that a new decision had been made to reinstate US style DST in Mexico....
# http://www.conae.gob.mx/ahorro/horaver2001_m1_2002.html (2002-02-20)
# confirms this.  Sonora as usual is the only state where DST is not applied.

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-05):
# Formerly there was an America/Ensenada zone, which differed from
# America/Tijuana only in that it did not observe DST from 1976
# through 1995.  This was as per Shanks.  However, Guy Harris reports
# that the 1987 OAG says "Only Ensenada, Mexicale, San Felipe and
# Tijuana observe DST," which contradicts Shanks but does imply that
# DST-observance was a town-by-town matter back then.  This concerns
# data after 1970 so most likely there should be at least one Zone
# other than America/Tijuana for Baja, but it's not clear yet what its
# name or contents should be.

# Cuba

# From Arthur David Olson (1999-03-29):
# The 1999-03-28 exhibition baseball game held in Havana, Cuba, between
# the Cuban National Team and the Baltimore Orioles was carried live on
# the Orioles Radio Network, including affiliate WTOP in Washington, DC.
# During the game, play-by-play announcer Jim Hunter noted that
# "We'll be losing two hours of sleep...Cuba switched to Daylight Saving
# Time today."  (The "two hour" remark referred to losing one hour of
# sleep on 1999-03-28--when the announcers were in Cuba as it switched
# to DST--and one more hour on 1999-04-04--when the announcers will have
# returned to Baltimore, which switches on that date.)

# From Rives McDow (2000-12-01):
# Dominican Republic changed its mind and presidential decree on Tuesday,
# November 28, 2000, with a new decree.  On Sunday, December 3 at 1:00 AM the
# Dominican Republic will be reverting to 8 hours from the International Date
# Line, and will not be using DST in the foreseeable future.  The reason they
# decided to use DST was to be in synch with Puerto Rico, who was also going
# to implement DST.  When Puerto Rico didn't implement DST, the president
# decided to revert.

# From Dave Cantor (2004-11-02):
# Early this summer I had the occasion to visit the Mount Washington
# Observatory weather station atop (of course!) Mount Washington [, NH]....
# One of the staff members said that the station was on Eastern Standard Time
# and didn't change their clocks for Daylight Saving ... so that their
# reports will always have times which are 5 hours behind UTC.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-08-26):
# According to today's Huntsville Times
# <http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/base/news/1125047783228320.xml&coll=1>
# a few towns on Alabama's "eastern border with Georgia, such as Phenix City
# in Russell County, Lanett in Chambers County and some towns in Lee County,
# set their watches and clocks on Eastern time."  It quotes H.H. "Bubba"
# Roberts, city administrator in Phenix City. as saying "We are in the Central
# time zone, but we do go by the Eastern time zone because so many people work
# in Columbus."

#  "Except for St. Paul and Akutan, Unalaska is the only important

#
# - Clark, Floyd, and Harrison counties have been like
#   America/Kentucky/Louisville.
#
# - Crawford, Daviess, Dubois, Knox, Martin, Perry, Pike, Pulaski, Starke,

#
# Shanks partitioned Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
# and wrote ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''

# From Paul Eggert (2006-01-20):
# It says "DOT is relocating the time zone boundary in Indiana to move Starke,
# Pulaski, Knox, Daviess, Martin, Pike, Dubois, and Perry Counties from the
# Eastern Time Zone to the Central Time Zone.... The effective date of
# this rule is 2:OO a.m. EST Sunday, April 2, 2006, which is the
# changeover date from standard time to Daylight Saving Time."
# Strictly speaking, this means the affected counties will change their
# clocks twice that night, but this obviously is in error.  The intent
# is that 01:59:59 EST be followed by 02:00:00 CDT.

# From Gwillim Law (2007-02-10):

# From Paul Eggert (2006-06-27):

# meridian is supposed to observe AST, but residents as far east as
# Natashquan use EST/EDT, and residents east of Natashquan use AST.
# In "Official time in Quebec" the Quebec department of justice writes in

# that "The residents of the Municipality of the
# Cote-Nord-du-Golfe-Saint-Laurent and the municipalities of Saint-Augustin,

# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-09):
# Chris Walton (2006-07-06) mentioned an article by Stephanie MacLellan in the
# 2005-07-21 Chronicle-Journal, which said:
#
#	The clocks in Atikokan stay set on standard time year-round.
#	This means they spend about half the time on central time and
#	the other half on eastern time.
#
#	For the most part, the system works, Mayor Dennis Brown said.
#
#	"The majority of businesses in Atikokan deal more with Eastern
#	Canada, but there are some that deal with Western Canada," he
#	said.  "I don't see any changes happening here."
#
# Walton also writes "Supposedly Pickle Lake and Mishkeegogamang
# [New Osnaburgh] follow the same practice."

# From Garry McKinnon (2006-07-14) via Chris Walton:
# I chatted with a member of my board who has an outstanding memory
# and a long history in Atikokan (and in the telecom industry) and he
# can say for certain that Atikokan has been practicing the current
# time keeping since 1952, at least.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-17):
# Shanks & Pottenger say that Atikokan has agreed with Rainy River
# ever since standard time was introduced, but the information from
# McKinnon sounds more authoritative.  For now, assume that Atikokan
# switched to EST immediately after WWII era daylight saving time
# ended.  This matches the old (less-populous) America/Coral_Harbour
# entry since our cutoff date of 1970, so we can move
# America/Coral_Harbour to the 'backward' file.

# From Rob Douglas (2006-04-06):
# the old Manitoba Time Act - as amended by Bill 2, assented to
# March 27, 1987 ... said ...
# "between two o'clock Central Standard Time in the morning of
# the first Sunday of April of each year and two o'clock Central
# Standard Time in the morning of the last Sunday of October next
# following, one hour in advance of Central Standard Time."...
# I believe that the English legislation [of the old time act] had =
# been assented to (March 22, 1967)....
# Also, as far as I can tell, there was no order-in-council varying
# the time of Daylight Saving Time for 2005 and so the provisions of
# the 1987 version would apply - the changeover was at 2:00 Central
# Standard Time (i.e. not until 3:00 Central Daylight Time).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-04-10):
# Shanks & Pottenger say Manitoba switched at 02:00 (not 02:00s)
# starting 1966.  Since 02:00s is clearly correct for 1967 on, assume
# it was also 02:00s in 1966.

# (both dated 2003), and
# http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/SO98/geomap.asp
# (from a 1998 Canadian Geographic article), the de facto and de jure time
# for Southampton Island (at the north end of Hudson Bay) is UTC-5 all year
# round.  Using Google, it's easy to find other websites that confirm this.
# I wasn't able to find how far back this time regimen goes, but since it
# predates the creation of Nunavut, it probably goes back many years....
# The Inuktitut name of Coral Harbour is Sallit, but it's rarely used.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2005-07-26):
# For lack of better information, assume that Southampton Island observed
# daylight saving only during wartime.

# From Chris Walton (2007-03-01):
# ... the community of Resolute (located on Cornwallis Island in
# Nunavut) moved from Central Time to Eastern Time last November.
# Basically the community did not change its clocks at the end of
# daylight saving....
# http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2006-11/nov13_06none.html

# From Chris Walton (2007-03-14):
# Today I phoned the "hamlet office" to find out what Resolute was doing with
# its clocks.
#
# The individual that answered the phone confirmed that the clocks did not
# move at the end of daylight saving on October 29/2006.  He also told me that
# the clocks did not move this past weekend (March 11/2007)....

# From Chris Walton (2008-11-13):
# ...the residents of Resolute believe that they are changing "time zones"
# twice a year.  In winter months, local time is qualified with "Eastern
# Time" which is really "Eastern Standard Time (UTC-5)".  In summer
# months, local time is qualified with "Central Time" which is really
# "Central Daylight Time (UTC-5)"...

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-03-09):
# I'm in Maryland which is now observing United States Eastern Daylight
# Time. At 9:44 local time I used RealPlayer to listen to
# <a href="http://media.enet.cu/radioreloj">
# http://media.enet.cu/radioreloj
# </a>, a Cuban information station, and heard
# the time announced as "ocho cuarenta y cuatro" ("eight forty-four"),
# indicating that Cuba is still on standard time.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-03-12):
# It seems that Cuba will start DST on Sunday, 2007-03-16...
# It was announced yesterday, according to this source (in Spanish):
# <a href="http://www.nnc.cubaweb.cu/marzo-2008/cien-1-11-3-08.htm">
# http://www.nnc.cubaweb.cu/marzo-2008/cien-1-11-3-08.htm

# http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/cuba-starts-dst-march-16.html
# </a>
#
# The article also says that Cuba has been observing DST since 1963,
# while Shanks (and tzdata) has 1965 as the first date (except in the
# 1940's). Many other web pages in Cuba also claim that it has been
# observed since 1963, but with the exception of 1970 - an exception
# which is not present in tzdata/Shanks. So there is a chance we need to
# change some historic records as well.
#
# One example:
# <a href="http://www.radiohc.cu/espanol/noticias/mar07/11mar/hor.htm">
# http://www.radiohc.cu/espanol/noticias/mar07/11mar/hor.htm

# From Jesper Norgaard Welen (2008-03-13):
# The Cuban time change has just been confirmed on the most authoritative

# http://www.granma.cubaweb.cu/2008/03/13/nacional/artic10.html
# </a>
#
# Basically as expected after Steffen Thorsens information, the change
# will take place midnight between Saturday and Sunday.

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-03-12):
# Assume Sun>=15 (third Sunday) going forward.

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2009-03-04)
# According to the Radio Reloj - Cuba will start Daylight Saving Time on
# midnight between Saturday, March 07, 2009 and Sunday, March 08, 2009-

# <a href="http://www.haitianconsulate.org/time.doc"> press release
# on the Web page of the Haitian Consulate in Chicago (2005-03-31),
# </a>.  Translated from French, it says:
#
#  "The Prime Minister's Communication Office notifies the public in general
#   and the press in particular that, following a decision of the Interior
#   Ministry and the Territorial Collectivities [I suppose that means the
#   provinces], Haiti will move to Eastern Daylight Time in the night from next
#   Saturday the 2nd to Sunday the 3rd.
#
#  "Consequently, the Prime Minister's Communication Office wishes to inform
#   the population that the country's clocks will be set forward one hour

#   October 2005.
#
#  "Port-au-Prince, March 31, 2005"
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-04-04):
# I have been informed by users that Haiti observes DST this year like

# "max" rule or to last until 2006. (Who knows if they will observe DST
# next year or if they will extend their DST like US/Canada next year).
#
# I have found this article about it (in French):

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-02-01):
# Here's database-relevant material from the 2001 "Alaska History" article:
#
# On September 20 [1979]...DOT...officials decreed that on April 27,
# 1980, Juneau and other nearby communities would move to Yukon Time.
# Sitka, Petersburg, Wrangell, and Ketchikan, however, would remain on
# Pacific Time.
#
# ...on September 22, 1980, DOT Secretary Neil E. Goldschmidt rescinded the
# Department's September 1979 decision. Juneau and other communities in
# northern Southeast reverted to Pacific Time on October 26.
#
# On October 28 [1983]...the Metlakatla Indian Community Council voted
# unanimously to keep the reservation on Pacific Time.
#
# According to DOT official Joanne Petrie, Indian reservations are not
# bound to follow time zones imposed by neighboring jurisdictions.
#
# (The last is consistent with how the database now handles the Navajo
# Nation.)

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-02-09):
# I just spoke by phone with a staff member at the Metlakatla Indian
# Community office (using contact information available at
# <a href="http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/commdb/CIS.cfm?Comm_Boro_name=Metlakatla">
# http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/commdb/CIS.cfm?Comm_Boro_name=Metlakatla
# </a>).
# It's shortly after 1:00 here on the east coast of the United States;
# the staffer said it was shortly after 10:00 there. When I asked whether
# that meant they were on Pacific time, they said no--they were on their
# own time. I asked about daylight saving; they said it wasn't used. I
# did not inquire about practices in the past.

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-08-17):
# For lack of better information, assume that Metlakatla's
# abandonment of use of daylight saving resulted from the 1983 vote.

# 13, 1896 (page 218), that in "1933, the Legislature decreed daylight
# saving for the period between the last Sunday of each April and the
# last Sunday of each September, but less than a month later repealed the
# act," (page 220), that year-round daylight saving time was in effect
# from 1942-02-09 to 1945-09-30 (page 221, with no time of day given for

# and Act 163 (approved 21 May 1933)."

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-01-19):
# The following is from "Laws of the Territory of Hawaii Passed by the
# Seventeenth Legislature: Regular Session 1933," available (as of
# 2011-01-19) at American University's Pence Law Library. Page 85: "Act
# 90...At 2 o'clock ante meridian of the last Sunday in April of each
# year, the standard time of this Territory shall be advanced one
# hour...This Act shall take effect upon its approval. Approved this 26th
# day of April, A. D. 1933. LAWRENCE M JUDD, Governor of the Territory of
# Hawaii." Page 172:  "Act 163...Act 90 of the Session Laws of 1933 is
# hereby repealed...This Act shall take effect upon its approval, upon
# which date the standard time of this Territory shall be restored to
# that existing immediately prior to the taking effect of said Act 90.
# Approved this 21st day of May, A. D. 1933. LAWRENCE M. JUDD, Governor
# of the Territory of Hawaii."
#
# Note that 1933-05-21 was a Sunday.
# We're left to guess the time of day when Act 163 was approved; guess noon.

# From Mark Brader (2010-03-06):
#
# Currently the database has:
#
# # Ontario
#
# # From Paul Eggert (2006-07-09):
# # Shanks & Pottenger write that since 1970 most of Ontario has been like
# # Toronto.
# # Thunder Bay skipped DST in 1973.
# # Many smaller locales did not observe peacetime DST until 1974;
# # Nipigon (EST) and Rainy River (CST) are the largest that we know of.
#
# In the (Toronto) Globe and Mail for Saturday, 1955-09-24, in the bottom
# right corner of page 1, it says that Toronto will return to standard
# time at 2 am Sunday morning (which agrees with the database), and that:
#
#     The one-hour setback will go into effect throughout most of Ontario,
#     except in areas like Windsor which remains on standard time all year.
#
# Windsor is, of course, a lot larger than Nipigon.
#
# I only came across this incidentally.  I don't know if Windsor began
# observing DST when Detroit did, or in 1974, or on some other date.
#
# By the way, the article continues by noting that:
#
#     Some cities in the United States have pushed the deadline back
#     three weeks and will change over from daylight saving in October.

# From Arthur David Olson (2010-07-17):
#
# "Standard Time and Time Zones in Canada" appeared in

#   A list of the places in Canada using daylight saving time would
# require yearly revision. From information kindly furnished by
# the provincial governments and by the postmasters in many cities
# and towns, it is found that the following places used daylight sav-
# ing in 1930. The information for the province of Quebec is definite,
# for the other provinces only approximate:
#
# 	Province	Daylight saving time used
# Prince Edward Island	Not used.
# Nova Scotia		In Halifax only.
# New Brunswick		In St. John only.
# Quebec		In the following places:
# 			Montreal	Lachine
# 			Quebec		Mont-Royal
# 			Levis		Iberville
# 			St. Lambert	Cap de la Madeleine
# 			Verdun		Loretteville
# 			Westmount	Richmond

# 			Longueuil	Greenfield Park
# 			Arvida		Waterloo
# 			Chambly-Canton	Beaulieu
# 			Melbourne	La Tuque
# 			St. Theophile	Buckingham
# Ontario		Used generally in the cities and towns along
# 			the southerly part of the province. Not
# 			used in the northwesterlhy part.
# Manitoba		Not used.
# Saskatchewan		In Regina only.
# Alberta		Not used.
# British Columbia	Not used.

# From Chris Walton (2011-03-21):
# Back in 2007 I initiated the creation of a new "zone file" for Resolute
# Bay. Resolute Bay is a small community located about 900km north of
# the Arctic Circle. The zone file was required because Resolute Bay had
# decided to use UTC-5 instead of UTC-6 for the winter of 2006-2007.
#
# According to new information which I received last week, Resolute Bay
# went back to using UTC-6 in the winter of 2007-2008...
#
# On March 11/2007 most of Canada went onto daylight saving. On March
# 14/2007 I phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office to do a "time check." I
# talked to somebody that was both knowledgeable and helpful. I was able
# to confirm that Resolute Bay was still operating on UTC-5. It was
# explained to me that Resolute Bay had been on the Eastern Time zone
# (EST) in the winter, and was now back on the Central Time zone (CDT).
# i.e. the time zone had changed twice in the last year but the clocks
# had not moved. The residents had to know which time zone they were in
# so they could follow the correct TV schedule...
#
# On Nov 02/2008 most of Canada went onto standard time. On Nov 03/2008 I
# phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office...[D]ue to the challenging nature
# of the phone call, I decided to seek out an alternate source of
# information. I found an e-mail address for somebody by the name of
# Stephanie Adams whose job was listed as "Inns North Support Officer for
# Arctic Co-operatives." I was under the impression that Stephanie lived
# and worked in Resolute Bay...
#
# On March 14/2011 I phoned the hamlet office again. I was told that
# Resolute Bay had been using Central Standard Time over the winter of
# 2010-2011 and that the clocks had therefore been moved one hour ahead
# on March 13/2011. The person I talked to was aware that Resolute Bay
# had previously experimented with Eastern Standard Time but he could not
# tell me when the practice had stopped.
#
# On March 17/2011 I searched the Web to find an e-mail address of
# somebody that might be able to tell me exactly when Resolute Bay went
# off Eastern Standard Time. I stumbled on the name "Aziz Kheraj." Aziz
# used to be the mayor of Resolute Bay and he apparently owns half the
# businesses including "South Camp Inn." This website has some info on
# Aziz:
# <a href="http://www.uphere.ca/node/493">
# http://www.uphere.ca/node/493
# </a>
#
# I sent Aziz an e-mail asking when Resolute Bay had stopped using
# Eastern Standard Time.
#
# Aziz responded quickly with this: "hi, The time was not changed for the
# 1 year only, the following year, the community went back to the old way
# of "spring ahead-fall behind" currently we are zulu plus 5 hrs and in
# the winter Zulu plus 6 hrs"
#
# This of course conflicted with everything I had ascertained in November 2008.
#
# I sent Aziz a copy of my 2008 e-mail exchange with Stephanie. Aziz
# responded with this: "Hi, Stephanie lives in Winnipeg. I live here, You
# may want to check with the weather office in Resolute Bay or do a
# search on the weather through Env. Canada. web site"
#
# If I had realized the Stephanie did not live in Resolute Bay I would
# never have contacted her.  I now believe that all the information I
# obtained in November 2008 should be ignored...
# I apologize for reporting incorrect information in 2008.

# The quote includes these two statements:
# 'Sunday the CPR went back to the old system of time...'
# '... The daylight saving scheme was dropped all over Canada at the same time,'
# These statements refer to a transition from daylight time to standard time
# that occurred nationally on Sunday October 27/1918.  This transition was
# also documented in the Saturday October 26/1918 edition of the Toronto Star.

# In light of that evidence, we alter the date from the earlier believed

# It seems though that (re: Creston) is not entirely correct:

# From Chris Walton (2011-12-01):
# There are two areas within the Canadian province of British Columbia
# that do not currently observe daylight saving:
# a) The Creston Valley (includes the town of Creston and surrounding area)
# b) The eastern half of the Peace River Regional District
# (includes the cities of Dawson Creek and Fort St. John)

# Earlier this year I stumbled across a detailed article about the time
# keeping history of Creston; it was written by Tammy Hardwick who is the
# manager of the Creston & District Museum. The article was written in May 2009.
# <a href="http://www.ilovecreston.com/?p=articles&t=spec&ar=260">
# http://www.ilovecreston.com/?p=articles&t=spec&ar=260
# </a>
# According to the article, Creston has not changed its clocks since June 1918.
# i.e. Creston has been stuck on UTC-7 for 93 years.
# Dawson Creek, on the other hand, changed its clocks as recently as April 1972.

# Unfortunately the exact date for the time change in June 1918 remains
# unknown and will be difficult to ascertain.  I e-mailed Tammy a few months
# ago to ask if Sunday June 2 was a reasonable guess.  She said it was just
# as plausible as any other date (in June).  She also said that after writing the
# article she had discovered another time change in 1916; this is the subject
# of another article which she wrote in October 2010.

# Here is a summary of the three clock change events in Creston's history:
# 1. 1884 or 1885: adoption of Mountain Standard Time (GMT-7)
# Exact date unknown
# 2. Oct 1916: switch to Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8) 
# Exact date in October unknown;  Sunday October 1 is a reasonable guess.
# 3. June 1918: switch to Pacific Daylight Time (GMT-7)
# Exact date in June unknown; Sunday June 2 is a reasonable guess.
# note#1:
# On Oct 27/1918 when daylight saving ended in the rest of Canada,
# Creston did not change its clocks.
# note#2:
# During WWII when the Federal Government legislated a mandatory clock change,
# Creston did not oblige.
# note#3:
# There is no guarantee that Creston will remain on Mountain Standard Time
# (UTC-7) forever.
# The subject was debated at least once this year by the town Council.

# http://www.bclocalnews.com/kootenay_rockies/crestonvalleyadvance/news/116760809.html
# </a>

# During a period WWII, summer time (Daylight saying) was mandatory in Canada.
# In Creston, that was handled by shifting the area to PST (-8:00) then applying
# summer time to cause the offset to be -7:00, the same as it had been before
# the change.  It can be argued that the timezone abbreviation during this
# period should be PDT rather than MST, but that doesn't seem important enough
# (to anyone) to further complicate the rules.

# The transition dates (and times) are guesses.

# From Arthur David Olson (2012-03-11):
# The alterpresse.org source seems to show a US-style leap from 2:00 a.m. to

# Assume a US-style fall back as well XXX.
# Do not yet assume that the change carries forward past 2012 XXX.

# From Paul Eggert (2016-09-21):
# Dowd's proposal left many details unresolved, such as where to draw
# lines between time zones.  The key individual who made time zones
# work in the US was William Frederick Allen - railway engineer,
# managing editor of the Travelers' Guide, and secretary of the
# General Time Convention, a railway standardization group.  Allen
# spent months in dialogs with scientific and railway leaders,
# developed a workable plan to institute time zones, and presented it
# to the General Time Convention on 1883-04-11, saying that his plan
# meant "local time would be practically abolished" - a plus for
# railway scheduling.  By the next convention on 1883-10-11 nearly all
# railroads had agreed and it took effect on 1883-11-18 at 12:00.
# That Sunday was called the "day of two noons", as the eastern parts
# of the new zones observed noon twice.  Allen witnessed the
# transition in New York City, writing:
#
#   I heard the bells of St. Paul's strike on the old time.  Four
#   minutes later, obedient to the electrical signal from the Naval
#   Observatory ... the time-ball made its rapid descent, the chimes
#   of old Trinity rang twelve measured strokes, and local time was
#   abandoned, probably forever.
#
# Most of the US soon followed suit.  See:
# Bartky IR. The adoption of standard time. Technol Cult 1989 Jan;30(1):25-56.
# http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3105430
a415 31

# From Paul Eggert (2016-08-20):
# In early February 1948, in response to California's electricity shortage,
# PG&E changed power frequency from 60 to 59.5 Hz during daylight hours,
# causing electric clocks to lose six minutes per day.  (This did not change
# legal time, and is not part of the data here.)  See:
# Ross SA. An energy crisis from the past: Northern California in 1948.
# Working Paper No. 8, Institute of Governmental Studies, UC Berkeley,
# 1973-11.  http://escholarship.org/uc/item/8x22k30c
#
# In another measure to save electricity, DST was instituted from 1948-03-14
# at 02:01 to 1949-01-16 at 02:00, with the governor having the option to move
# the fallback transition earlier.  See pages 3-4 of:
# http://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/sites/clerk.assembly.ca.gov/files/archive/Statutes/1948/48Vol1_Chapters.pdf
#
# In response:
#
#   Governor Warren received a torrent of objecting mail, and it is not too much
#   to speculate that the objections to Daylight Saving Time were one important
#   factor in the defeat of the Dewey-Warren Presidential ticket in California.
#     -- Ross, p 25
#
# On December 8 the governor exercised the option, setting the date to January 1
# (LA Times 1948-12-09).  The transition time was 02:00 (LA Times 1949-01-01).
#
# Despite the controversy, in 1949 California voters approved Proposition 12,
# which established DST from April's last Sunday at 01:00 until September's
# last Sunday at 02:00. This was amended by 1962's Proposition 6, which changed
# the fall-back date to October's last Sunday. See:

# time.  Though delayed by the Great Fire, by 1880 a wire ran from the
# Dearborn Observatory (on the University of Chicago campus) to City Hall,
# which then sent signals to police and fire stations.  However, railroads got
# their time signals from the Allegheny Observatory, the Madison Observatory,
# the Ann Arbor Observatory, etc., so their clocks did not agree with each

# the last fly ball of the doubleheader settled into the glove of leftfielder
# Lenny Green, it was after 7 p.m.  Detroit did not observe daylight saving
# time, so light was already starting to fail.  Twilight was made even deeper
# by billowing columns of smoke that ascended in an unbroken wall north of the

# However, El Paso ignored the law for decades and continued to observe

# Eventually the federal government gave in and changed the law on

# A brief but entertaining history of time in Indiana describes a 1949 debate
# in the Indiana House where city legislators (who favored "fast time")
# tussled with farm legislators (who didn't) over a bill to outlaw DST:
#  "Lacking enough votes, the city faction tries to filibuster until time runs
#   out on the session at midnight, but rural champion Rep. Herbert Copeland,
#   R-Madison, leans over the gallery railing and forces the official clock
#   back to 9 p.m., breaking it in the process.  The clock sticks on 9 as the
#   debate rages on into the night.  The filibuster finally dies out and the
#   bill passes, while outside the chamber, clocks read 3:30 a.m.  In the end,
#   it doesn't matter which side won.  The law has no enforcement powers and
#   is simply ignored by fast-time communities."

# Quebec

# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-09):
# Shanks & Pottenger write that since 1970 most of Quebec has been
# like Montreal.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-06-27):
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) also write that Quebec east of the -63
# meridian is supposed to observe AST, but residents as far east as
# Natashquan use EST/EDT, and residents east of Natashquan use AST.
# In "Official time in Quebec" the Quebec department of justice writes in
# http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/temps-regl-1-a.htm
# that "The residents of the Municipality of the
# Cote-Nord-du-Golfe-Saint-Laurent and the municipalities of Saint-Augustin,
# Bonne-Esperance and Blanc-Sablon apply the Official Time Act as it is
# written and use Atlantic standard time all year round. The same applies to
# the residents of the Native facilities along the lower North Shore."
# <http://www.assnat.qc.ca/eng/37legislature2/Projets-loi/Publics/06-a002.htm>
# says this common practice was codified into law as of 2007.
# For lack of better info, guess this practice began around 1970, contra to
# Shanks & Pottenger who have this region observing AST/ADT.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-09):
# Chris Walton (2006-07-06) mentioned an article by Stephanie MacLellan in the
# 2005-07-21 Chronicle-Journal, which said:
#
#	The clocks in Atikokan stay set on standard time year-round.
#	This means they spend about half the time on central time and
#	the other half on eastern time.
#
#	For the most part, the system works, Mayor Dennis Brown said.
#
#	"The majority of businesses in Atikokan deal more with Eastern
#	Canada, but there are some that deal with Western Canada," he
#	said.  "I don't see any changes happening here."
#
# Walton also writes "Supposedly Pickle Lake and Mishkeegogamang
# [New Osnaburgh] follow the same practice."

# From Garry McKinnon (2006-07-14) via Chris Walton:
# I chatted with a member of my board who has an outstanding memory
# and a long history in Atikokan (and in the telecom industry) and he
# can say for certain that Atikokan has been practicing the current
# time keeping since 1952, at least.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-17):
# Shanks & Pottenger say that Atikokan has agreed with Rainy River
# ever since standard time was introduced, but the information from
# McKinnon sounds more authoritative.  For now, assume that Atikokan
# switched to EST immediately after WWII era daylight saving time
# ended.  This matches the old (less-populous) America/Coral_Harbour
# entry since our cutoff date of 1970, so we can move
# America/Coral_Harbour to the 'backward' file.

# From Rob Douglas (2006-04-06):
# the old Manitoba Time Act - as amended by Bill 2, assented to
# March 27, 1987 ... said ...
# "between two o'clock Central Standard Time in the morning of
# the first Sunday of April of each year and two o'clock Central
# Standard Time in the morning of the last Sunday of October next
# following, one hour in advance of Central Standard Time."...
# I believe that the English legislation [of the old time act] had =
# been assented to (March 22, 1967)....
# Also, as far as I can tell, there was no order-in-council varying
# the time of Daylight Saving Time for 2005 and so the provisions of
# the 1987 version would apply - the changeover was at 2:00 Central
# Standard Time (i.e. not until 3:00 Central Daylight Time).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-04-10):
# Shanks & Pottenger say Manitoba switched at 02:00 (not 02:00s)
# starting 1966.  Since 02:00s is clearly correct for 1967 on, assume
# it was also 02:00s in 1966.
