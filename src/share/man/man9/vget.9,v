.Dt VGET 9
.Sh NAME
.Nm vget
.Nd get a vnode from the free list
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Fd #include <sys/vnode.h>
.Ft int
.Fn vget "struct vnode *vp" "int flags" "struct proc *p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Get a vnode from the free list and increment its reference count.
.Pp
Its arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width flags
.It Fa vp
The vnode to remove from the free list.
.It Fa flags
If non-zero, the vnode will also be locked.
.It Fa p
The process responsible for this call.
.El
.Pp
When not in use, vnodes are kept on a free list.
The vnodes still
reference valid files but may be reused to refer to a new file at any
time.
Often, these vnodes are also held in caches in the system, such
as the name cache.
.Pp
When a vnode which is on the free list is used again, for instance if
the vnode was found in the name cache as a result of a call to
.Xr VOP_LOOKUP 9 ,
then the new user must call
.Fn vget
to increment the reference count and remove it from the free list.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The vnode
.Fa vp
is in the process of being cleaned out from the underlying
filesystem.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr vnode 9 ,
.Xr vput 9 ,
