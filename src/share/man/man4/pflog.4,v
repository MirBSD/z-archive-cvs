log
@Revert almost everything of the diff which updated PF.

Reason: pppoe(4) did not work any more (and HERC crashed, too).
Probable cause: the interface groups code.

I do not have time to look into this.

.Sh NAME
.Nm pflog
.Nd packet filter logging interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device pflog"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm pflog
interface is a pseudo-device which makes visible all packets logged by
the packet filter,
.Xr pf 4 .
Logged packets can easily be monitored in real
time by invoking
.Xr tcpdump 8
on the
.Nm
interface, or stored to disk using
.Xr pflogd 8 .
.Pp
Each packet retrieved on this interface has a header associated
with it of length
.Dv PFLOG_HDRLEN .
This header documents the address family, interface name, rule
number, reason, action, and direction of the packet that was logged.
This structure, defined in
.Aq Pa net/if_pflog.h
looks like
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct pfloghdr {
	u_int8_t	length;
	sa_family_t	af;
	u_int8_t	action;
	u_int8_t	reason;
	char		ifname[IFNAMSIZ];
	char		ruleset[PF_RULESET_NAME_SIZE];
	u_int32_t	rulenr;
	u_int32_t	subrulenr;
	u_int8_t	dir;
	u_int8_t	pad[3];
};
.Ed
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig pflog0 up
# tcpdump -n -e -ttt -i pflog0
.Ed

.Xr inet 4 ,
.Xr inet6 4 ,
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr pf 4 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
.Xr pflogd 8 ,
.Xr tcpdump 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device first appeared in
.Ox 3.0 .
.\" .Sh BUGS
.\" Anything here?
