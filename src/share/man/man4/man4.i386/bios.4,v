@turn the K7 PowerNow driver into a device with flags,
changeable via UKC. Also, no action is taken if the speed
is not changed any more, we don't hold lock on 128 KiB of
unused RAM, allow selection of the correct PST or none at
all, list available PSTs verbosely, show available (but
not unusable (fid/vid == 0)) frequencies, offer a debug
mode for K7PN developers, have a nice manual page, do not
disturb on non-K7 boxen at all, look nice in general, use
more static functions and variables where possible, ...

.Sh NAME
.Nm bios
.Nd a driver for PC Firmware, aka BIOS
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bios0    at mainbus0 flags 0x0000"
.Cd "apm0     at bios0 flags 0x0000"
.Cd "pcibios0 at bios0 flags 0x0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ox
provides support for PC firmware, aka BIOS and some of its functions,
currently: APM subsystem, BIOS 32 extensions, PCI BIOS subsystem.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also identifies BIOS type (such as "AT/286+", which is
almost always used in modern machines) and BIOS image date stamp,
which is, presumably, the day the BIOS image was compiled by vendor
and could be used as a crude BIOS version identification.
The
.Nm
driver also scans the ISA memory hole at 640K-1M for optional
ROM images and reserves the space from being used by various
ISA devices, for example
.Xr pcic 4 .
.Pp
Flags is a bit mask each bit of which specifies which functions
of the driver to disable.
.Bl -tag -width 0x0001
.It 0x0001
BIOS 32 attachment.
.Pp
Do not probe and attach to BIOS 32 extensions, which is one of
the interfaces to the PCI BIOS configuration tables.
.It 0x0002
PCI BIOS attachment.
.Pp
Do not probe and attach the
.Xr pcibios 4
device, which performs certain PCI configuration tasks.
.It 0x0004
Do not perform the scan for ROM images in the ISA memory hole
(0xc0000 - 0xf0000 physical addresses).
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr apm 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pcibios 4 ,
.Xr pcmcia 4 ,
.Xr powernowhack 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Ox 2.2 .
.Sh BUGS
On some machines optional ROM images do not pass checksum check,
but it's considered better to reserve space for those anyway,
choosing lesser evil from many.

.It 0x0008
Usually, if the first AMD K7 PowerNow!(TM) attachment fails,
attaching is tried a second time, using the first PCT found,
even if the CPU signature does not match.
Usage of this option disables this behaviour on AMD K7 CPUs.

WARNING: this is dangerous, only use it if you know what you
are doing!
