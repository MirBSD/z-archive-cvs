.Sh NAME
.Nm install.sparc
.Nd stub installation instructions for the sparc architecture
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /install
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes how to install the
.Mx
operating system on a sparc (sun4c, sun4m) machine.
.Sh OBTAINING INSTALLATION MEDIA
The
.Mx
homepage (see below) contains a comprehensive list of possibilities to
get bootable installation media.
In many cases, you will download MirOS from the internet via HTTP or
BitTorrent.
On some conferences and fairs, you can also get CDs directly from the
developers.
You can also mail them to have a CD sent to you if you don't have
broadband.
.Pp
For more information, refer to the
.Xr install.i386 7
manual page for now.
.Pp
You can either boot from a pretty minimal floppy image
.Pa floppy\nv.fs ,
from a CD-ROM image (either the full CD or the minimal
.Pa cdrom\nv.iso
image), or netboot a
.Pa bsd.rd
ELF format gzip'd kernel using
.Pa boot ,
formerly called
.Pa boot.net ,
or netboot a directly bootable
.Pa bsd.rd.net
a.out format kernel.
.Sh NETBOOTING
This section is a stub.
For now, refer to the
.Ox
documentation at
.Pa http://pub.allbsd.org/OpenBSD/3.5/sparc/INSTALL.sparc
for details or ask in IRC.
You can usually replace the
.Dl server# ln -s boot.MACHINE.OpenBSD.$KARCH 8273900B.$KARCH
line with
.Dl server$ sudo ln -s bsd.rd.net 8273900B.$KARCH
to make use of our netbootable kernels.
Note that
.Dq 8273900B
is the hexadecimal, big-endian representation of the IPv4 address.
.Sh PARTITIONING
The sparc architecture does not use MBR partitioning, so that you
can skip reading about the fdisk utility in the i386 instructions.
On the contrary, rather than storing a native BSD disklabel in
sector #1 inside the
.Mx
partition, a Sun disklabel is stored in sector #0 of the medium.
It is important that the
.Ql a
slice begin at sector #0 as well.
.Sh INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
Please see the
.Xr install.i386 7
manual page for a detailed walkthrough.
This manual page currently is only a stub.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr boot_sparc 8 ,
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
.Xr diskless 8

The MirOS homepage:
.Pa http://mirbsd.de/
.Sh HISTORY
Support for the sparc architecture first appeared in
.Mx 7ter .
It re-appeared in
.Mx 10 ,
although the floppy image came back only with
.Mx 11 ,
promoted to a fully supported architecture.

log
@actually, our /v10/sparc/boot is a boot.net in .Ox terms, as it’s already
converted to the special sparc firmware a.out format during dist build
but miod was right and netbooting bsd.net without boot(.net) will not load
the symbol table, so this part is retained (bsd.rd comes without ddb(4) so
it’s not important there)

@• install.i386(7):
  ‣ add licence
  ‣ use Mdocdate
  ‣ use “umin” to update MBR code, not “update”, to prevent overwriting
    the Microsoft® NT® disc UUID
  ‣ link to boot_i386(8)
  ‣ sort .Sx SEE ALSO
  ‣ add IRC link
  ‣ add CVSweb link to local copy of NTRawrite
• install.sparc(7): new, only a stub for now, points to other docs
