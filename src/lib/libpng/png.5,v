.Sh NAME
.Nm png
.Nd Portable Network Graphics format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library contains functions dealing with files in the PNG format.
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is an extensible file format for
the lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images.
PNG provides a patent-free replacement for GIF and can also
replace many common uses of TIFF.
Indexed-colour, grayscale, and truecolour images are supported,
plus an optional alpha channel.
Sample depths range from 1 to 16 bits.
.Pp
PNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications, such
as the World Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a
progressive display option.
PNG is robust, providing both full file integrity checking and
fast, simple detection of common transmission errors.
Also, PNG can storegamma and chromaticity data for improved
colour matching on heterogeneous platforms.

1.1.107.5
log
@Import libpng-1.2.25 with the following change log.
Requested by bsiegert@@ due to security fix relevance.

version 1.2.19beta1 [May 18, 2007]
  Changed "const static" to "static PNG_CONST" everywhere, mostly undoing
    change of libpng-1.2.17beta2.  Changed other "const" to "PNG_CONST"
  Changed some handling of unused parameters, to avoid compiler warnings.
    "if (unused == NULL) return;" becomes "unused = unused".

version 1.2.19beta2 [May 18, 2007]
  Only use the valid bits of tRNS value in png_do_expand() (Brian Cartier)

version 1.2.19beta3 [May 19, 2007]
  Add some "png_byte" typecasts in png_check_keyword() and write new_key
  instead of key in zTXt chunk (Kevin Ryde).

version 1.2.19beta4 [May 21, 2007]
  Add png_snprintf() function and use it in place of sprint() for improved
    defense against buffer overflows.

version 1.2.19beta5 [May 21, 2007]
  Fixed png_handle_tRNS() to only use the valid bits of tRNS value.
  Changed handling of more unused parameters, to avoid compiler warnings.
  Removed some PNG_CONST in pngwutil.c to avoid compiler warnings.

version 1.2.19beta6 [May 22, 2007]
  Added some #ifdef PNG_MMX_CODE_SUPPORTED where needed in pngvcrd.c
  Added a special "_MSC_VER" case that defines png_snprintf to _snprintf

version 1.2.19beta7 [May 22, 2007]
  Squelched png_squelch_warnings() in pnggccrd.c and added an
    #ifdef PNG_MMX_CODE_SUPPORTED block around the declarations that caused
    the warnings that png_squelch_warnings was squelching.

version 1.2.19beta8 [May 22, 2007]
  Removed __MMX__ from test in pngconf.h.

version 1.2.19beta9 [May 23, 2007]
  Made png_squelch_warnings() available via PNG_SQUELCH_WARNINGS macro.
  Revised png_squelch_warnings() so it might work.
  Updated makefile.sgcc and makefile.solaris; added makefile.solaris-x86.

version 1.2.19beta10 [May 24, 2007]
  Resquelched png_squelch_warnings(), use "__attribute__((used))" instead.

version 1.2.19beta11 [May 28, 2007]
  Return 0 from png_get_sPLT() and png_get_unknown_chunks() if png_ptr is NULL;
    changed three remaining instances of png_strcpy() to png_strncpy() (David
    Hill).
  Make test for NULL row_buf at the beginning of png_do_read_transformations
    unconditional.

version 1.2.19beta12 [May 28, 2007]
  Revised pnggccrd.c.

version 1.2.19beta13 [June 14, 2007]
  Prefer PNG_USE_PNGVCRD when _MSC_VER is defined in pngconf.h

version 1.2.19beta14 [June 16, 2007]
  Fix bug with handling of 16-bit transparency, introduced in 1.2.19beta2

version 1.2.19beta15 [June 17, 2007]
  Revised pnggccrd.c.

version 1.2.19beta16 [June 18, 2007]
  Revised pnggccrd.c again.
  Updated contrib/gregbook.
  Changed '#include "pnggccrd.c"' to 'include "$srcdir/pnggccrd.c"'
    in configure.ac

version 1.2.19beta17 [June 19, 2007]
  Revised many of the makefiles, to set -DPNG_NO_MMX_CODE where needed
    and to not use -O3 unless -DPNG_NO_MMX_CODE is also set.

version 1.2.19beta18 [June 23, 2007]
  Replaced some C++ style comments with C style comments in pnggccrd.c.
  Copied optimized C code from pnggccrd.c to pngrutil.c, removed dependency
    on pnggccrd.o from many makefiles.
  Added sl and dylib to list of extensions be installed by Makefile.am

version 1.2.19beta19 [June 28, 2007]
  Fixed testing PNG_RGB_TO_GRAY_ERR & PNG_RGB_TO_GRAY_WARN in pngrtran.c
  More cleanup of pnggccrd.c and pngvcrd.c

version 1.2.19beta20 [June 29, 2007]
  Rebuilt Makefile.in and configure using libtool-1.5.24.
  Fixed typo in pnggccrd.c

version 1.2.19beta21 [June 30, 2007]
  More revision of pnggccrd.c
  Added "test" target to Makefile.in and Makefile.am

version 1.2.19beta22 [July 3, 2007]
  Added info about pngrutil/pnggccrd/pngvcrd to png_get_header_version()
  Fix type definition of dummy_value_a, b in pnggccrd.c

version 1.2.19beta23 [July 10, 2007]
  Revert change to type definition of dummy_value_a, b in pnggccrd.c
  Make sure __PIC__ is defined in pnggccrd.c when PIC is defined.
  Require gcc-4.1 or better to use PNG_HAVE_MMX_FILTER_ROW on x86_64 platforms

version 1.2.19beta24 [July 14, 2007]
  Added PNG_NO_READ_FILTER, PNG_NO_WRITE_FILTER, PNG_NO_WARNING macros.
  Added contrib/pngminim to demonstrate building minimal encoder and decoder

version 1.2.19beta25 [July 15, 2007]
  Removed the new PNG_NO_READ_FILTER macro since it would make the library
    unable to read valid PNG files, and filtering is at the heart of the
    PNG format.

version 1.2.19beta26 [July 16, 2007]
  Changed "png_free(str)" to "png_free(png_ptr,str)" in pngrutil.c WinCE
    code (Yves Piguet).  This bug was introduced in libpng-1.2.14.
  Updated scripts/CMakeLists.txt
  Relocated a misplaced #endif in pnggccrd.c

version 1.2.19beta27 [July 17, 2007]
  Fixed incorrect stride and number of bytes copied (was 4 instead of
    6 bytes) in the cleanup loop of pnggccrd.c and pngvcrd.c for handling
    the end of 48-bit interlaced rows (Glenn R-P).

version 1.2.19beta28 [July 19, 2007]
  Removed requirement for gcc-4.1 or better to use PNG_HAVE_MMX_FILTER_ROW
    on x86_64 platforms
  Added png_warning() in pngrutil.c for short iCCP, iTXt, sPLT, or zTXT chunks.
  Revised pngtest.c so warnings are displayed regardless of PNG_NO_STDIO.

version 1.2.19beta29 [July 20, 2007]
  Fix typo in pnggccrd.c (%%eax should be %%ax in secondloop48)

version 1.2.19beta30 [July 26, 2007]
  Revised pnggccrd.c

version 1.2.19beta31 [July 27, 2007]
  Fix typos in pnggccrd.c

version 1.0.27rc1 and 1.2.19rc1 [July 31, 2007]
  Disable PNG_MMX_CODE_SUPPORTED when PNG_ASSEMBLER_CODE_SUPPORTED is off.
  Enable PNG_MMX_READ_FILTER_* by default, except when gcc-3.x is being
    used (they were inadvertently disabled in libpng-1.2.19beta23).
  Fix some debugging statements in pnggccrd.c and pngrutil.c
  Added information about disabling the MMX code in libpng documentation.

version 1.0.27rc2 and 1.2.19rc2 [August 4, 2007]
  Removed some "#if 0" blocks.

  Fix typo (missing '"') in pnggccrd.c
  Revise handling of png_strtod in recent versions of WINCE

version 1.0.27rc6 and 1.2.19rc6 [August 15, 2007]
