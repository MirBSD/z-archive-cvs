.TH mitem_userptr 3 ""
.SH NAME
\fBmitem_userptr\fR - associate application data with a menu item
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <menu.h>\fR
.br
int set_item_userptr(ITEM *item, void *userptr);
.br
void *item_userptr(const ITEM *item);
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
Every menu item has a field that can be used to hold application-specific data
(that is, the menu-driver code leaves it alone).  These functions get and set
that field.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Except for \fBitem_userptr\fR (which returns \fBNULL\fR on error), each function returns one of the following:
.TP 5
\fBE_OK\fR
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
\fBE_SYSTEM_ERROR\fR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR).
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3), \fBmenu\fR(3).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<menu.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V menu library.  They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.

The user pointer should be a void pointer.  We leave it as a char pointer for
SVr4 compatibility.

Juergen Pfeifer.  Manual pages and adaptation for new curses by Eric
S. Raymond.
