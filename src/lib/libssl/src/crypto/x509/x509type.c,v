@backport upstream commit ac38115c1a4fb61c66c2a8cd2a9800751828d328:
    Correctly check for export size limit
    40 bit ciphers are limited to 512 bit RSA, 56 bit ciphers to 1024 bit.

also add note about upstream commit to limit DH size to > 768 bit
which handles more cases than we do but has issues still (to be fixed)
