/* X509_REQ_INFO is handled in an unusual way to get round
 * invalid encodings. Some broken certificate requests don't
 * encode the attributes field if it is empty. This is in
 * violation of PKCS#10 but we need to tolerate it. We do
 * this by making the attributes field OPTIONAL then using
 * the callback to initialise it to an empty STACK. 
 *
 * This means that the field will be correctly encoded unless
 * we NULL out the field.
 *
 * As a result we no longer need the req_kludge field because
 * the information is now contained in the attributes field:
 * 1. If it is NULL then it's the invalid omission.
 * 2. If it is empty it is the correct encoding.
 * 3. If it is not empty then some attributes are present.
