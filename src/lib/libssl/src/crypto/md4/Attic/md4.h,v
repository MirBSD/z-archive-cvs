@replace OpenSSLâ€™s MD4 by minimal adapter around MirBSD implementation

type             16 bytes     64 bytes    256 bytes   1024 bytes   8192 bytes
OpenSSL           7986.94k    29371.09k    90663.33k   192134.21k   285419.63k
MirBSD            7824.78k    25051.96k    62529.97k   103412.33k   126034.92k

This saves us 4491 bytes in the .so file though, and is much better
for maintenance and sustainability (especially with SHA-2 yet to come).
Also, having only one codepath is better.
