@… and CAST. That’s it. AES is not in libc, and DES scares me silly.

Bad thing here: CAST has useless use of bswap award. We cannot fix
this without adding API to libc. But I’d prefer to not have those
huge S-boxen in two places, so it’s either do that or remove CAST
from OpenSSL altogether (it’s not in TLS anyway, just in crypto,
and GnuPG ships its own).

@There is a ppro flag in cast-586 which turns on/off
generation of pentium pro/II friendly code

This flag makes the inner loop one cycle longer, but generates 
code that runs %30 faster on the pentium pro/II, while only %7 slower
on the pentium.  By default, this flag is on.
