@â€¦ and Blowfish, at least partially
@
text
@This is a quick packaging up of my blowfish code into a library.
It has been lifted from SSLeay.
The copyright notices seem a little harsh because I have not spent the
time to rewrite the conditions from the normal SSLeay ones.

Basically if you just want to play with the library, not a problem.
