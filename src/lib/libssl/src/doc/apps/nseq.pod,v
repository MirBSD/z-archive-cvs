=head1 NAME

nseq - create or examine a netscape certificate sequence

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<openssl> B<nseq>
[B<-in filename>]
[B<-out filename>]
[B<-toseq>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<nseq> command takes a file containing a Netscape certificate
sequence and prints out the certificates contained in it or takes a
file of certificates and converts it into a Netscape certificate
sequence.

=head1 COMMAND OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-in filename>

This specifies the input filename to read or standard input if this
option is not specified.

=item B<-out filename>

specifies the output filename or standard output by default.

=item B<-toseq>

normally a Netscape certificate sequence will be input and the output
is the certificates contained in it. With the B<-toseq> option the
situation is reversed: a Netscape certificate sequence is created from
a file of certificates.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

Output the certificates in a Netscape certificate sequence

 openssl nseq -in nseq.pem -out certs.pem

Create a Netscape certificate sequence

 openssl nseq -in certs.pem -toseq -out nseq.pem

=head1 NOTES

The B<PEM> encoded form uses the same headers and footers as a certificate:

 -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
 -----END CERTIFICATE-----

A Netscape certificate sequence is a Netscape specific form that can be sent
to browsers as an alternative to the standard PKCS#7 format when several
certificates are sent to the browser: for example during certificate enrollment.
It is used by Netscape certificate server for example.

=head1 BUGS

This program needs a few more options: like allowing DER or PEM input and
output files and allowing multiple certificate files to be used.
