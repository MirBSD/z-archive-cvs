@The OpenSSL  shared libraries are often installed in a directory like
/usr/local/ssl/lib.

If this directory is not in a standard system path for dynamic/shared
libraries, then you will have problems linking and executing
applications that use OpenSSL libraries UNLESS:

* you link with static (archive) libraries.  If you are truly
  paranoid about security, you should use static libraries.
* you use the GNU libtool code during linking
  (http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/libtool.html)
* you use pkg-config during linking (this requires that
  PKG_CONFIG_PATH includes the path to the OpenSSL shared
  library directory), and make use of -R or -rpath.
  (http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/)
* you specify the system-wide link path via a command such
  as crle(1) on Solaris systems.
* you add the OpenSSL shared library directory to /etc/ld.so.conf
  and run ldconfig(8) on Linux systems.
* you define the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LIBPATH, SHLIB_PATH (HP),
  DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (MacOS X) or PATH (Cygwin and DJGPP)
  environment variable and add the OpenSSL shared library
  directory to it.

One common tool to check the dynamic dependencies of an executable
or dynamic library is ldd(1) on most UNIX systems.

See any operating system documentation and manpages about shared
libraries for your version of UNIX.  The following manpages may be
helpful: ld(1), ld.so(1), ld.so.1(1) [Solaris], dld.sl(1) [HP],
ldd(1), crle(1) [Solaris], pldd(1) [Solaris], ldconfig(8) [Linux],
chatr(1) [HP].
