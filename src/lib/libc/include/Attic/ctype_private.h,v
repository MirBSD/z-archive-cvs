log
@* the non-wide ctype stuff now also uses the wctype structure
  (saves duplicate rodata) and has been rewritten from scratch
* the non-inline version of the non-wide ctype stuff honours
  the MIR18N_C_CSET definition now as well
* tolower/toupper also rewritten from scratch, honouring the
  MIR18N_C_CSET definition (there is no inline version, and
  _tolower/_toupper are same stupid as usual), much smaller
