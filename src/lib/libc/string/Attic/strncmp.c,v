@• kern: new KERNISUSR (defined by libc and libmdsup, but not by either
  bootloader or kernel), enables new NUSRCS, UIF_NUSRCS
• move MD strncmp() to kern
• move MI {str,wcs}case{,n}cmp to kern
• make wcs* functions NU not KU as we don’t need them in the kernel YET
• move __main to NU (it’s a joke anyway, I think)
• bootloader: make devsw_prefix_match case-insensitive
