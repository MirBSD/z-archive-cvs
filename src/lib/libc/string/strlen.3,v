@• timingsafe_memcmp is not the same as timingsafe_bcmp, remove
• remove timingsafe_bcmp from libkern
• (re-)add timingsafe_bcmp and timingsafe_memcmp to libc
• update omalloc
• newly add reallocarray to libc
• add strnlen to libc, fix strndup to not read beyond size with that
• update manpages and add MLINKS: strndup, strnlen, timingsafe_*cmp

.Pp
The
.Fn strnlen
function computes the length of the string
.Fa s ,
up to
.Fa maxlen
characters.
The
.Fn strnlen
function will never attempt to address more than
.Fa maxlen
characters, making it suitable for use with character arrays that are
not guaranteed to be NUL-terminated.

.Pp
The
.Fn strnlen
function returns the number of characters that precede the terminating
.Tn NUL
or
.Fa maxlen ,
whichever is smaller.
