@“long double” in MirBSD (i386 and sparc, both) is currently just plain wrong and will lead to bad results; fix the code if needed

log
@Add strtof and strtold to libc.

They are simple wrappers around the existing strtod implementation.
In MirOS, double and long double are the same anyway. This change is needed
because the two functions are part of C99, so there is a bunch of software
that uses them without a configure check.
