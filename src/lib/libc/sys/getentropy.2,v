.Sh NAME
.Nm getentropy
.Nd get entropy
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft int
.Fn getentropy "char *buf" "size_t buflen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
fills a buffer with high-quality seed-grade entropy, which can
be used as input for process-context random
generators like
.Xr arc4random 3 .
On
.Mx ,
the previous contents of the buffer is added to the kernel lopool first.
.Pp
The maximum buffer size permitted is 256 bytes.
If
.Va buflen
exceeds this, an error of
.Er EIO
will be indicated.
.Pp
.Nm
is not intended for regular code; please use the
.Xr arc4random 3
family of functions instead.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn getentropy
will succeed unless:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa buf
parameter points to an
invalid address.
.It Bq Er EIO
Too many bytes requested, or some other fatal error occurred.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr arc4random 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
function appeared in
.Ox 5.6 .
