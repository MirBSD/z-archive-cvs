.Dt GETLINE 3
.Os GNU
.Sh NAME
.Nm getline
.Nd get a line from a stream
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #define _GNU_SOURCE
.Fd #include <stdio.h>
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn getline "char **buf" "size_t *len" "FILE *stream"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getline
function is a GNU extension and should not be used in new code.
It is only implemented in
.Mx
for compatibility reasons.
Thus, no description is provided, but feel free to send us a diff.
It basically does the same as
.Xr fgetln 3 ,
reallocating or resizing the
.Fa *buf
argument if necessary, and NUL-terminating the result.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn getline
function was first introduced to BSD in
.Mx 10 .
