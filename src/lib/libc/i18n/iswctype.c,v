@switch to a one-locale system; "the" locale is UTF-8 encoded 'C' now;
inline many simpler functions for reduced code size / imports / speed
and optimise a little - XXX untested

log
@add CESU-8 as alias for UTF-8 since that is what we actually
use system-wide, outside of citrus (since our wchar_t is BMP
only)

XXX add CESU-8 read/write to citrus_utf8.c, no explicit op-
XXX tion to switch CESU-8 write on, just use wchar size

yes I know, CESU-8 "should not be used to interchange data",
but there is no way (outside of citrus) within mirbsd to in-
terchange UCS-4 data other than as UTF-16 (wchar_t *) or
CESU-8 (char *) strings, or convert them.
