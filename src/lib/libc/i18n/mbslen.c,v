@switch to a one-locale system; "the" locale is UTF-8 encoded 'C' now;
inline many simpler functions for reduced code size / imports / speed
and optimise a little - XXX untested

log
@add two functions, mbslen(3) and mbswidth(3), no manpages yet (Benny!),
which mirror wcslen(3) and wcswidth(3) functionality; mbslen is more
fast than anything else, mbswidth operates as fast as possible too
these can be used for non-standard cheap i18n support in user apps
