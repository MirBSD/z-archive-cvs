1.2
log
@proof-of-concept implementation of a few functions for the
new "kern" directory containing stuff shared between
* userland (-fhosted -lgcc)
* kernel (-ffreestanding -D_KERNEL -nostdlib)
* bootloader (-ffreestanding -D_STANDALONE -nostdlib)

Here, userland and kernel share some functions not for the
bootloader (e.g. utf-8 stuff), while kernel and bootloader
share a few libgcc replacement functions.

I took the htonl() &c. functions because they were pretty
easy to implement; no sparc assembly version because it's
a 'no-op' and I trust gcc so much as to produce optimised
output for the type foo(type x) { return (x); } case.

Not tested.

Most of the functions will be written "on demand" and re-
written from scratch by me.
