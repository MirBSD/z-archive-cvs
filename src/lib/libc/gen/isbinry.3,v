.Sh NAME
.Nm isbinry
.Nd binary octet test
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #define _ALL_SOURCE
.Fd #include <ctype.h>
.Ft int
.Fn isbinry "int c"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn isbinry
macro tests whether its argument is a binary octet, i.e. an octet
not used in encoding OPTU-8 text or the NUL byte.
It is intended to be used in ascii-vs-binary tests, e.g. in
.Xr diff 1 ,
.Xr grep 1 ,
or similar tools.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn isbinry
macro returns zero if the character is potentially used in encoding
OPTU-8 text, non-zero otherwise.
If the argument is not in the range 0..255, the result is undefined.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr isascii 3 ,
.Xr utf-8 7
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn isbinry
macro is a
.Mx
extension.
A
.Fn isbinry
function shall be provided in libc with the same semantics as the macro.
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn isbinry
first appeared in
.Mx 10 .

@new: isbinry(), implemented as a macro in <ctype.h> (MirOS extension,
only visible with -D_ALL_SOURCE et al.) and in libc for lint only

returns true if its argument is one of the octets that aren't used in
CESU-8 text (C0, C1, F0..FF) or the NUL byte, 0 otherwise
