.Dt VALLOC 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm valloc
.Nd aligned memory allocation function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft void *
.Fn valloc "size_t size"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
The
.Fn valloc
function is obsoleted by the current version of
.Xr malloc 3 ,
which aligns page-sized and larger allocations.
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Fn valloc
function allocates
.Fa size
bytes aligned on a page boundary.
It is implemented by calling
.Xr malloc 3
with a slightly larger request, saving the true beginning of the block
allocated, and returning a properly aligned pointer.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn valloc
function returns
a pointer to the allocated space if successful; otherwise a
null pointer is returned.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn valloc
function appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
A
.Fn vfree
function has not been implemented.
