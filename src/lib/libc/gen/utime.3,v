.Dt UTIME 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm utime
.Nd set file times
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <utime.h>
.Ft int
.Fn utime "const char *file" "const struct utimbuf *timep"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This interface is obsoleted by
.Xr utimes 2 .
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Fn utime
function sets the access and modification times of the named file.
.Pp
If
.Fa timep
is
.Dv NULL ,
the access and modification times are set to the current time.
The calling process must be the owner of the file or have permission to
write the file.
.Pp
If
.Fa timep
is non-null, it specifies a pointer to a
.Li utimbuf
structure, as defined in
.Aq Pa utime.h :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct utimbuf {
	time_t actime;		/* Access time */
	time_t modtime;		/* Modification time */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The access time is set to the value of the
.Fa actime
member, and the modification
time is set to the value of the
.Fa modtime
member.
The times are measured in
seconds since 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds, January 1, 1970, Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC).
The calling process must be the owner of the file or be the superuser.
.Pp
In either case, the inode change-time of the file is set to the current
time.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn utime
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix;
or the
.Fa timep
argument is
.Dv NULL
and the effective user ID of the process does not
match the owner of the file, the effective user ID is not that of the
superuser,
and write access is denied.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
.Fa file
or
.Fa timep
points outside the process's allocated address space.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit set.
.It Bq Er EIO
An
.Tn I/O
error occurred while reading or writing the affected inode.
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters,
or an entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The named file does not exist.
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The
.Fa timep
argument is not
.Dv NULL
and the calling process's effective user ID
does not match the owner of the file and is not the superuser.
.It Bq Er EROFS
The filesystem containing the file is mounted read-only.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr stat 2 ,
.Xr utimes 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn utime
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-88 .
