.Dt GETMNTINFO 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getmntinfo
.Nd get information about mounted filesystems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Fd #include <sys/mount.h>
.Ft int
.Fn getmntinfo "struct statfs **mntbufp" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getmntinfo
function returns an array of
.Xr statfs
structures describing each currently mounted filesystem (see
.Xr statfs 2 ) .
.Pp
The
.Fn getmntinfo
function passes its
.Fa flags
parameter transparently to
.Xr getfsstat 2 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On successful completion,
.Fn getmntinfo
returns a count of the number of elements in the array.
The pointer to the array is stored into
.Fa mntbufp .
.Pp
If an error occurs, zero is returned and the external variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
Although the pointer
.Fa mntbufp
will be unmodified, any information previously returned by
.Fn getmntinfo
will be lost.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn getmntinfo
function may fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the library routines
.Xr getfsstat 2
or
.Xr malloc 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr getfsstat 2 ,
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr statfs 2 ,
.Xr mount 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn getmntinfo
function first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fn getmntinfo
function writes the array of structures to an internal static object
and returns a pointer to that object.
Subsequent calls to
.Fn getmntinfo
will modify the same object.
.Pp
The memory allocated by
.Fn getmntinfo
cannot be
.Xr free 3 Ns 'd
by the application.
