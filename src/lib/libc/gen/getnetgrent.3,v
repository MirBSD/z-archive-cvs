.Sh NAME
.Nm getnetgrent ,
.Nm innetgr ,
.Nm setnetgrent ,
.Nm endnetgrent
.Nd netgroup database operations
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <netgroup.h>
.Ft int
.Fn getnetgrent "const char **host" "const char **user" "const char **domain"
.Ft int
.Fn innetgr "const char *netgroup" "const char *host" "const char *user" "const char *domain"
.Ft void
.Fn setnetgrent "const char *netgroup"
.Ft void
.Fn endnetgrent void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions operate on the netgroup database file
.Pa /etc/netgroup.db
which is described
in
.Xr netgroup 5 .
The database defines a set of netgroups, each made up of one or more triples:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
(host, user, domain)
.Ed
.Pp
that defines a combination of host, user, and domain.
Any of the three fields may be specified as
.Dq wildcards
that match any string.
.Pp
The function
.Fn getnetgrent
sets the three pointer arguments to the strings of the next member of the
current netgroup.
If any of the string pointers are
.Dv NULL ,
those fields are considered wildcards.
.Pp
The functions
.Fn setnetgrent
and
.Fn endnetgrent
set the current netgroup and terminate the current netgroup respectively.
If
.Fn setnetgrent
is called with a different netgroup than the previous call, an implicit
.Fn endnetgrent
is implied.
.Fn setnetgrent
also sets the offset to the first member of the netgroup.
.Pp
The function
.Fn innetgr
searches for a match of all fields within the specified group.
If any of the
.Ar host ,
.Ar user ,
or
.Ar domain
arguments are
.Dv NULL ,
those fields will match any string value in the netgroup member.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The function
.Fn getnetgrent
returns 0 for
.Dq no more netgroup members
or 1 otherwise.
The function
.Fn innetgr
returns 1 for a successful match or 0 otherwise.
The functions
.Fn setnetgrent
and
.Fn endnetgrent
have no return value.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/netgroup.db -compact
.It Pa /etc/netgroup.db
netgroup database file
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr netgroup 5
.Sh BUGS
The function
.Fn getnetgrent
returns pointers to dynamically allocated data areas that are
.Xr free 3 Ns 'd when
the function
.Fn endnetgrent
is called.

If that file does not exist, and the system supports YP,
then the netgroup YP databases are used instead.
