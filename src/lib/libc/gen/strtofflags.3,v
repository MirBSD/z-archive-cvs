.Sh NAME
.Nm fflagstostr ,
.Nm strtofflags
.Nd convert between file flag bits and their string names
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft char *
.Fn fflagstostr "u_int32_t flags"
.Ft int
.Fn strtofflags "char **stringp" "u_int32_t *setp" "u_int32_t *clrp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fflagstostr
function returns a comma separated string of the file flags represented by
.Fa flags .
If no flags are set a zero length string is returned.
.Pp
If memory cannot be allocated for the return value,
.Fn fflagstostr
returns
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
The value returned from
.Fn fflagstostr
is obtained from
.Fn malloc
and should be returned to the system with
.Fn free
when the program is done with it.
.Pp
The
.Fn strtofflags
function takes a string of file flags, as described in
.Xr chflags 1 ,
parses it, and returns the
.Dq set
and
.Dq clear
flags such as would be given as arguments to
.Xr chflags 2 .
On success,
.Fn strtofflags
returns 0, otherwise it returns non-zero and
.Fa stringp
is left pointing to the offending token.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn fflagstostr
function may fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the library routine
.Xr malloc 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chflags 1 ,
.Xr chflags 2 ,
.Xr malloc 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn fflagstostr
and
.Fn strtofflags
functions first appeared in
.Ox 2.8 .
