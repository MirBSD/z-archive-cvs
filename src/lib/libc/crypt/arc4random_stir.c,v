log
@new implementation of arc4random(3) API (except arc4random_uniform(3),
which though has been split off earlier today)

deprecate arc4random_push arc4random_pushb arc4random_pushk
in favour of arc4random_pushb_fast as well

hide internal symbols from user with a version script (only some,
until the next major bump)

make deprecated functions into macros already

switch some kernel code to use the new shared code already; rewrite
of kernel arc4random(9) will come next/later
