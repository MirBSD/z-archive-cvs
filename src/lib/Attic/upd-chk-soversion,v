@big fat licence update (I left some which are bsiegert@@'s alone though)
also, remove licence boilerplate from some .h files who don't deserve it
and remove and add some advertising clauses because I say so

@* usr.bin/sudo/noexec doesn't need a shlib_version maintained because
  we only want to build the PIC (bundle)
* lib/libossaudio doesn't need a shlib_version monitored any more because
  we stopped building it as (7 KiB) shared library shortly ago

@* merge bin and lib completely
* convert some ancient RCSID styles etc. to more modern stuff
* fix use of CDIAGFLAGS+=, CFLAGS+= and COPTS+= to the correct
  variant (include bsd.own.mk _then_ COPTS+=) so they're added
  after any user-specified flags
  (this is probably lurking in more places than I can imagine)
* fix some indenting, comments, etc.
* make stuff compile (fix warnings/errors)
* add script to review _all_ shlib_version after an openbsd import
* remove two more obsolete /usr/lib/debug/ references
* bin/ps: comment out some SMP code
