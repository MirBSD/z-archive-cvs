/* Expat tries very hard to make the API boundary very specifically
   defined.  There are two macros defined to control this boundary;
   each of these can be defined before including this header to
   achieve some different behavior, but doing so it not recommended or
   tested frequently.

   XMLCALL    - The calling convention to use for all calls across the
                "library boundary."  This will default to cdecl, and
                try really hard to tell the compiler that's what we
                want.

   XMLIMPORT  - Whatever magic is needed to note that a function is
                to be imported from a dynamically loaded library
                (.dll, .so, or .sl, depending on your platform).

   The XMLCALL macro was added in Expat 1.95.7.  The only one which is
   expected to be directly useful in client code is XMLCALL.

   Note that on at least some Unix versions, the Expat library must be
   compiled with the cdecl calling convention as the default since
   system headers may assume the cdecl convention.

@revive expat, after "discovering" it's being used by XFree86Æ...

The plan is that, after the release, when the base system (including
X11 and GCC) is split up into several ports, we'll just have a depen-
dency on expat in X11 ports where needed, and until then, we'll just
keep it in base.
