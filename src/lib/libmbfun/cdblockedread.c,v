*might* just work… well…

@new library for all those pesky functions like cdblockedread() or
my arc4random extensions or ambstowcs(3) or whatever other MirBSD
specific functions we provide – this way, they can be shared on a
crunchgen(1)d executable (such as ramdisks’ instbin) but need not
affect libc or other shared libraries’ versions

XXX manpages ought to still be mandated
