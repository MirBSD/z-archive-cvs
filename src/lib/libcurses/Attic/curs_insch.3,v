.SH NAME
\fBinsch\fR,
\fBwinsch\fR,
\fBmvinsch\fR,
\fBmvwinsch\fR - insert a character before cursor in a \fBcurses\fR window
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR

\fBint insch(chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBint winsch(WINDOW *win, chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBint mvinsch(int y, int x, chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBint mvwinsch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, chtype ch);\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines insert the character \fIch\fR before the character under the
cursor.  All characters to the right of the cursor are moved one space to the
right, with the possibility of the rightmost character on the line being lost.
The insertion operation does not change the cursor position.
.SH RETURN VALUE
All routines that return an integer return \fBERR\fR upon failure and OK (SVr4
specifies only "an integer value other than \fBERR\fR") upon successful
completion, unless otherwise noted in the preceding routine descriptions.
.SH NOTES
These routines do not necessarily imply use of a hardware insert character
feature.

Note that \fBinsch\fR, \fBmvinsch\fR, and \fBmvwinsch\fR may be macros.
.SH PORTABILITY
These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3).
