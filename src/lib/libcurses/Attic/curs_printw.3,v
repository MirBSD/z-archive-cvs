.SH NAME
\fBprintw\fR,
\fBwprintw\fR,
\fBmvprintw\fR,
\fBmvwprintw\fR,
\fBvwprintw\fR, \fBvw_printw\fR - print formatted output in \fBcurses\fR windows
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR

\fBint printw(char *fmt\fR [\fB, arg\fR] \fB...);\fR
.br
\fBint wprintw(WINDOW *win, char *fmt\fR [\fB, arg\fR] \fB...);\fR
.br
\fBint mvprintw(int y, int x, char *fmt\fR [\fB, arg\fR] \fB...);\fR
.br
\fBint mvwprintw(WINDOW *win, int y, int x,\fR
      \fBchar *fmt\fR [\fB, arg]\fR ...);

\fB#include <stdarg.h>\fR
.br
\fBint vwprintw(WINDOW *win, char *fmt, varglist);\fR
.br
\fBint vw_printw(WINDOW *win, char *fmt, varglist);\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBprintw\fR, \fBwprintw\fR, \fBmvprintw\fR and \fBmvwprintw\fR
routines are analogous to \fBprintf\fR [see \fBprintf\fR(3)].  In
effect, the string that would be output by \fBprintf\fR is output
instead as though \fBwaddstr\fR were used on the given window.

The \fBvwprintw\fR routine is analogous to \fBvprintf\fR [see
\fBprintf\fR(3)] and performs a \fBwprintw\fR using a variable
argument list.  The third argument is a \fBva_list\fR, a pointer to a
list of arguments, as defined in \fB<stdarg.h>\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Routines that return an integer return \fBERR\fR upon failure and \fBOK\fR
(SVr4 only specifies "an integer value other than \fBERR\fR") upon successful
completion.
.SH PORTABILITY
The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.  The function
\fBvwprintw\fR is marked TO BE WITHDRAWN, and is to be replaced by a function
\fBvw_printw\fR using the \fB<stdarg.h>\fR interface.
