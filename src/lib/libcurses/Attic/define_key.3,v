.SH NAME
\fBdefine_key\fP \- define a keycode
..
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fP

\fBint define_key(const char *definition, int keycode);\fP
..
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is an extension to the curses library.
It permits an application to define keycodes with their corresponding control
strings, so that the curses library will interpret them just as it would
the predefined codes in the terminfo database.
.PP
If the given string is null, any existing definition for the keycode is
removed.
Similarly, if the given keycode is negative or zero, any existing string
for the given definition is removed.
..
.SH RETURN VALUE
The keycode must be greater than zero, else ERR is returned.
..
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported on
Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that
any code depending on them be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
..
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBkeyok\fR(3).
