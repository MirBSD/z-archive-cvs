.SH NAME
\fBinch\fR, \fBwinch\fR, \fBmvinch\fR, \fBmvwinch\fR
- get a character and attributes from a \fBcurses\fR window
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR

\fBchtype inch(void);\fR
.br
\fBchtype winch(WINDOW *win);\fR
.br
\fBchtype mvinch(int y, int x);\fR
.br
\fBchtype mvwinch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines return the character, of type \fBchtype\fR, at the current
position in the named window.  If any attributes are set for that position,
their values are OR'ed into the value returned.  Constants defined in
\fB<curses.h>\fR can be used with the \fB&\fR (logical AND) operator to
extract the character or attributes alone.

.SS Attributes
The following bit-masks may be AND-ed with characters returned by \fBwinch\fR.

.TS
l l .
\fBA_CHARTEXT\fR	Bit-mask to extract character
\fBA_ATTRIBUTES\fR	Bit-mask to extract attributes
\fBA_COLOR\fR	Bit-mask to extract color-pair field information
.TE
.SH NOTES
Note that all of these routines may be macros.
.SH PORTABILITY
These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3).
