.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions allow users to test conformance to
.St -ieee754 .
Their use is not otherwise recommended.
.Pp
.Fn logb x
returns
.Fa x Ns 's exponent
.Fa n ,
a signed integer converted to double\-precision floating\-point.
.Fn logb \*(Pm\*(If
= +\*(If;
.Fn logb 0
= -\*(If with a division by zero exception.
.Pp
.Fn scalbn x n
returns
.Fa x Ns \(**(2** Ns Fa n )
computed by exponent manipulation.
.Pp
.Fn significand x
returns
.Fa sig ,
where
.Fa x
:=
.Fa sig No \(** 2** Ns Fa n
with 1 \*(Le
.Fa sig
\*(Lt 2.
.Fn significand x
is not defined when
.Fa x
is 0, \*(Pm\*(If, or \*(Na.

@Import current libm from NetBSD, with the directories complex, noieee_src, arch/!i387 removed.

The idea is to get fmin and fmax, which are needed by some newer software.
