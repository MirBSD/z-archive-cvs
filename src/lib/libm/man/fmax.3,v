.Sh NAME
.Nm fmax ,
.Nm fmaxf ,
.Nm fmin ,
.Nm fminf
.Nd floating-point maximum and minimum functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn fmax "double x" "double y"
.Ft float
.Fn fmaxf "float x" "float y"
.Ft double
.Fn fmin "double x" "double y"
.Ft float
.Fn fminf "float x" "float y"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fmax
and
.Fn fmaxf
functions return the larger of
.Fa x
and
.Fa y ,
and likewise, the
.Fn fmin
and
.Fn fminf
functions return the smaller of
.Fa x
and
.Fa y .
They treat
.Li +0.0
as being larger than
.Li -0.0 .
If one argument is an \*(Na, then the other argument is returned.
If both arguments are \*(Nas, then the result is an \*(Na.
These routines do not raise any floating-point exceptions.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fabs 3 ,
.Xr fdim 3 ,
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn fmax ,
.Fn fmaxf ,
.Fn fmin
and
.Fn fminf
functions conform to
.St -isoC-99 .
.Sh HISTORY
These routines first appeared in
.Fx 5.3
and
.Nx 5.1 .

log
@Import current libm from NetBSD, with the directories complex, noieee_src, arch/!i387 removed.

The idea is to get fmin and fmax, which are needed by some newer software.
