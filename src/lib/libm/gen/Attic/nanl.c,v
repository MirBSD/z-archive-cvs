@tentative major bump to libm.so.7.0 which probably should have been
done instead of a minor bump to 6.2 back then… but what few did we
know… anyway, basically remove the “long double” remnants, since if
you were using it on MirBSD, you were Doing It Wrong already anyway
as sparc only has 32/64 bit float, and while i387 has 32/64/80 bit,
our FPUCW limits precision to 64 bit (and the ABIs are at issue for
whether “long double” should be stored with 80 or 96 bit and *THEN*
SSE wants 128-bit alignment for them, so…)

This removes “long double” functions nobody should have been using,
on i386, which doesn’t really warrant a major bump, and __infinity,
which our new libm provides as GCC builtin (and __infinityf was not
included anyway).

BUT! Do not use this yet. This needs verification on sparc, where a
Perl build failed due to having *more* (but actually even uselesser
– heh) long double stubs…

@Import current libm from NetBSD, with the directories complex, noieee_src, arch/!i387 removed.

The idea is to get fmin and fmax, which are needed by some newer software.
