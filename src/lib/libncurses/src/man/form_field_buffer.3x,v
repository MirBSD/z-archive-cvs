.TH form_field_buffer 3X ""
.SH NAME
\fBform_field_buffer\fR - field buffer control
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fR
.br
int set_field_buffer(FIELD *field, int buf, const char *value);
.br
char *field_buffer(const FIELD *field, int buffer);
.br
int set_field_status(FIELD *field, bool status);
.br
bool field_status(const FIELD *field);
.br
int set_max_field(FIELD *field, int max);
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBset_field_buffer\fR sets the numbered buffer of the given field
to contain a given string.  Buffer 0 is the displayed value of the field; other
numbered buffers may be allocated by applications through the \fBnbuf\fR
argument of (see \fBform_field_new\fR(3X)) but are not manipulated by the forms
library.  The function \fBfield_buffer\fR returns the address of the buffer.
Please note that this buffer has always the length of the buffer, that means
that it may typically contain trailing spaces. If you entered leading spaces
the buffer may also contain them. If you want the raw data, you must write your
own routine that copies the value out of the buffer and removes the leading
and trailing spaces. Please note also, that subsequent operations on the form
will probably change the content of the buffer. So do not use it for long term
storage of the entered form data.

The function \fBset_field_status\fR sets the associated status flag of
\fIfield\fR; \fBfield_status\fR gets the current value.  The status flag
is set to a nonzero value whenever the field changes.

The function \fBset_max_field\fR sets the maximum size for a dynamic field.
An argument of 0 turns off any maximum size threshold for that field.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The \fBfield_buffer\fR function returns NULL on error.

The \fBfield_status\fR function returns \fBTRUE\fR or \fBFALSE\fR.

The remaining routines return one of the following:
.TP 5
\fBE_OK\fR
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
\fBE_SYSTEM_ERROR\fR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR).
.TP 5
\fBE_BAD_ARGUMENT\fR
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X) and related pages whose names begin "form_" for detailed
descriptions of the entry points.
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fR automatically includes the header file

When configured for wide-characters, \fBfield_buffer\fP returns a pointer
to temporary storage (allocated and freed by the library).
The application should not attempt to modify the data.
It will be freed on the next call to \fBfield_buffer\fP to return the
same buffer.
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
