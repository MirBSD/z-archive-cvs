.SH NAME
\fBmitem_current\fR - set and get current_menu_item
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <menu.h>\fR
.br
int set_current_item(MENU *menu, const ITEM *item);
.br
ITEM *current_item(const MENU *menu);
.br
int set_top_row(MENU *menu, int row);
.br
int top_row(const MENU *menu);
.br
int item_index(const ITEM *item);
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBset_current_item\fR sets the current item (the item on which
the menu cursor is positioned).  \fBcurrent_item\fR returns a pointer to the
current item in the given menu.

The function \fBset_top_row\fR sets the top row of the menu to show the given
row (the top row is initially 0, and is reset to this value whenever the
\fBO_ROWMAJOR\fR option is toggled).  The item leftmost on the given row
becomes current.  The function \fBtop_row\fR returns the number of the top menu
row being displayed.

The function \fBitem_index\fR returns the (zero-origin) index of \fIitem\fR in
the menu's item pointer list.
.SH RETURN VALUE
\fBcurrent_item\fR returns \fBNULL\fR on error.

\fBtop_row\fR and \fBitem_index\fR return \fBERR\fR (the general \fBcurses\fR
error value) on error.

\fBset_current_item\fR and \fBset_top_row\fR return one of the following:
.TP 5
\fBE_OK\fR
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
\fBE_SYSTEM_ERROR\fR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR).
.TP 5
\fBE_BAD_ARGUMENT\fR
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
\fBE_BAD_STATE\fR
Routine was called from an initialization or termination function.
.TP 5
\fBE_NOT_CONNECTED\fR
No items are connected to the menu.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X), \fBmenu\fR(3X).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<menu.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V menu library.  They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.

The SVr4 menu library documentation specifies the \fBtop_row\fR and
\fBindex_item\fR error value as -1 (which is the value of \fBERR\fR).

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
