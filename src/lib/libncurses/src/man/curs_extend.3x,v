.SH NAME
\fBcurses_version\fP,
\fBuse_extended_names\fP \- miscellaneous curses extensions

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fP

\fBconst char * curses_version(void);\fP
.br
\fBint use_extended_names(bool enable);\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions are extensions to the curses library
which do not fit easily into other categories.
.PP
Use
.I curses_version()
to get the version number, including patch level of the library, e.g.,
.B 5.0.19991023
.PP
The
.I use_extended_names()
function controls whether the calling application
is able to use user-defined or nonstandard names
which may be compiled into the terminfo
description, i.e., via the terminfo or termcap interfaces.
Normally these names are available for use, since the essential decision
is made by using the \fB-x\fP option of \fItic\fP to compile
extended terminal definitions.
However you can disable this feature
to ensure compatibility with other implementations of curses.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported on
Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that
any code depending on them be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
