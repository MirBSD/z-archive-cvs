.SH NAME
\fBform_field_new\fR - create and destroy form fields
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fR
.br
FIELD *new_field(int height, int width,
                 int toprow, int leftcol,
                 int offscreen, int nbuffers);
.br
FIELD *dup_field(FIELD *field, int toprow, int leftcol);
.br
FIELD *link_field(FIELD *field, int toprow, int leftcol);
.br
int free_field(FIELD *field);
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBnew_field\fR allocates a new field and initializes it from the
parameters given: height, width, row of upper-left corner, column of upper-left
corner, number off-screen rows, and number of additional working buffers.

The function \fBdup_field\fR duplicates a field at a new location.  Most
attributes (including current contents, size, validation type, buffer count,
growth threshold, justification, foreground, background, pad character,
options, and user pointer) are copied.  Field status and the field page bit are
not copied.

The function \fBlink_field\fR acts like \fBdup_field\fR, but the new field
shares buffers with its parent.  Attribute data is separate.

The function \fBfree_field\fR de-allocates storage associated with a field.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The function, \fBnew_field\fR, \fBdup_field\fR, \fBlink_field\fR return
\fBNULL\fR on error.

The function \fBfree_field\fR returns one of the following:
.TP 5
\fBE_OK\fR
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
\fBE_SYSTEM_ERROR\fR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR).
.TP 5
\fBE_BAD_ARGUMENT\fR
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X), \fBform\fR(3X).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.

It may be unwise to count on the set of attributes copied by
\fBdup_field\fR(3X) being portable; the System V forms library documents are
not very explicit about what gets copied and what doesn't.
.SH AUTHORS
Juergen Pfeifer.  Manual pages and adaptation for new curses by Eric
S. Raymond.

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
