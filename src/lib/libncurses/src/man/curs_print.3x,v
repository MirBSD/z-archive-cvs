.SH NAME
\fBmcprint\fR - ship binary data to printer
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR

\fBint mcprint(char *data, int len);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function uses the \fBmc5p\fR or \fBmc4\fR and \fBmc5\fR capabilities,
if they are present, to ship given data to a printer attached to the terminal.

Note that the \fBmcprint\fR code has no way to do flow control with the printer
or to know how much buffering it has.  Your application is responsible for
keeping the rate of writes to the printer below its continuous throughput rate
(typically about half of its nominal cps rating).  Dot-matrix printers and
6-page-per-minute lasers can typically handle 80cps, so a good conservative
rule of thumb is to sleep for a second after shipping each 80-character line.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The \fBmcprint\fR function returns \fBERR\fR if the write operation aborted
for some reason.  In this case, errno will contain either an error associated
with \fBwrite(2)\fR or one of the following:
.TP 5
ENODEV
Capabilities for printer redirection do not exist.
.TP 5
ENOMEM
Couldn't allocate sufficient memory to buffer the printer write.

When \fBmcprint\fR succeeds, it returns the number of characters actually
sent to the printer.
.SH PORTABILITY
The \fBmcprint\fR call was designed for \fBncurses\fR(3X), and is not found
in SVr4 curses, 4.4BSD curses, or any other previous version of curses.
.SH BUGS
Padding in the \fBmc5p\fR, \fBmc4\fR and \fBmc5\fR capabilities will not be
interpreted.

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
