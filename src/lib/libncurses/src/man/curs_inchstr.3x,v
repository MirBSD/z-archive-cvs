.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR

\fBint inchstr(chtype *chstr);\fR
.br
\fBint inchnstr(chtype *chstr, int n);\fR
.br
\fBint winchstr(WINDOW *win, chtype *chstr);\fR

.br
\fBint mvwinchnstr(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, chtype *chstr, int n);\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines return a NULL-terminated array of \fBchtype\fR quantities,
starting at the current cursor position in the named window and ending at the
right margin of the window.  The four functions with \fIn\fR as
the last argument, return a leading substring at most \fIn\fR characters long
(exclusive of the trailing (chtype)0).
Constants defined in \fB<curses.h>\fR can be used with the \fB&\fR (logical
AND) operator to extract the character or the attribute alone from any position
in the \fIchstr\fR [see \fBcurs_inch\fR(3X)].
.SH RETURN VALUE
All routines return the integer \fBERR\fR upon failure and an integer value
other than \fBERR\fR upon successful completion (the number of characters
retrieved, exclusive of the trailing 0).
.PP
No error conditions are defined.
If the \fIchstr\fP parameter is null,
no data is returned,
and the return value is zero.
.SH NOTES
Note that all routines except \fBwinchnstr\fR may be macros.  SVr4 does not
document whether the result string is 0-terminated; it does not document
whether a length limit argument includes any trailing 0; and it does not
document the meaning of the return value.
.SH PORTABILITY
These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.  It is no
more specific than the SVr4 documentation on the trailing 0.  It does specify
that the successful return of the functions is \fBOK\fR.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X), \fBcurs_inch\fR(3X).

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
