.TH form_hook 3X ""
.SH NAME
\fBform_hook\fR - set hooks for automatic invocation by applications
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fR
.br
int set_field_init(FORM *form, void (*func)(FORM *));
.br
void (*)(FORM *) field_init(const FORM *form);
.br
int set_field_term(FORM *form, void (*func)(FORM *));
.br
void (*)(FORM *) field_term(const FORM *form);
.br
int set_form_init(FORM *form, void (*func)(FORM *));
.br
void (*)(FORM *) form_init(const FORM *form);
.br
int set_form_term(FORM *form, void (*func)(FORM *));
.br
void (*)(FORM *) form_term(const FORM *form);
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions make it possible to set hook functions to be called at various
points in the automatic processing of input event codes by \fBform_driver\fR.

The function \fBset_field_init\fR sets a hook to be called at form-post time
and each time the selected field changes (after the change).  \fBfield_init\fR
returns the current field init hook, if any (\fBNULL\fR if there is no such
hook).

The function \fBset_field_term\fR sets a hook to be called at form-unpost time
and each time the selected field changes (before the change).  \fBfield_term\fR
returns the current field term hook, if any (\fBNULL\fR if there is no such
hook).

The function \fBset_form_init\fR sets a hook to be called at form-post time and
just after a page change once it is posted.  \fBform_init\fR returns the
current form init hook, if any (\fBNULL\fR if there is no such hook).

The function \fBset_form_term\fR sets a hook to be called at form-unpost time
and just before a page change once it is posted.  \fBform_init\fR
returns the current form term hook, if any (\fBNULL\fR if there is no such
hook).
.SH RETURN VALUE
Routines that return pointers return \fBNULL\fR on error.  Other routines
return one of the following:
.TP 5
\fBE_OK\fR
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
\fBE_SYSTEM_ERROR\fR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR).
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X), \fBform\fR(3X).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.

S. Raymond.

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
