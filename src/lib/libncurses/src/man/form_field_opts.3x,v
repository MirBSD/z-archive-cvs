.TH form_field_opts 3X ""
.SH NAME
\fBform_field_opts\fR - set and get field options
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fR
.br
int set_field_opts(FIELD *field, OPTIONS opts);
.br
int field_opts_on(FIELD *field, OPTIONS opts);
.br
int field_opts_off(FIELD *field, OPTIONS opts);
.br
OPTIONS field_opts(const FIELD *field);
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBset_field_opts\fR sets all the given field's option bits (field
option bits may be logically-OR'ed together).

The function \fBfield_opts_on\fR turns on the given option bits, and leaves
others alone.

The function \fBfield_opts_off\fR turns off the given option bits, and leaves
others alone.

The function \fBfield_opts\fR returns the field's current option bits.

The following options are defined (all are on by default):
.TP 5
O_VISIBLE
The field is displayed.  If this option is off, display of the field is
suppressed.
.TP 5
O_ACTIVE
The field is visited during processing.  If this option is off, the field will
not be reachable by navigation keys. Please notice that an invisible field
appears to be inactive also.
.TP 5
O_PUBLIC
The field contents are displayed as data is entered.
.TP 5
O_EDIT
The field can be edited.
.TP 5
O_WRAP
Words that do not fit on a line are wrapped to the next line.  Words are
blank-separated.
.TP 5
O_BLANK
The field is cleared whenever a character is entered at the first position.
.TP 5
O_AUTOSKIP
Skip to the next field when this one fills.
.TP 5
O_NULLOK
Allow a blank field.
.TP 5
O_STATIC
Field buffers are fixed to field's original size.
Turn this option off to create a dynamic field.
.TP 5
O_PASSOK
Validate field only if modified by user.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Except for \fBfield_opts\fR, each routine returns one of the following:
.TP 5
\fBE_OK\fR
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
\fBE_SYSTEM_ERROR\fR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR).
.TP 5
\fBE_CURRENT\fR
The field is the current field.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X), \fBform\fR(3X).
.TP 5
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
