.br
.B "        const wchar_t *\fIwch\fP,"
.br
.B "        const attr_t \fIattrs\fP,"
.br
.B "        short \fIcolor_pair\fP,"
.br
.B "        void *\fIopts\fP );"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBgetcchar\fP function gets a wide-character string
and rendition from a \fBcchar_t\fP argument.
When \fIwch\fP is not a null pointer,
the \fBgetcchar\fP function does the following:
.TP 5
-
Extracts information from a \fBcchar_t\fP value \fIwcval\fP
.TP 5
-
Stores the character attributes in the location pointed to by \fIattrs\fP
.TP 5
-
Stores the color-pair in the location pointed to by \fIcolor_pair\fP
.TP 5
-
Stores the wide-character string,
characters referenced by \fIwcval\fP, into the array pointed to by \fIwch\fP.
.PP
When
\fIwch\fP
is a null pointer, the
\fBgetcchar\fP
function does the following:
.TP 5
-
Obtains the number of wide characters pointed to by \fIwcval\fP
.TP 5
-
Does not change the data referenced by
\fIattrs\fP
or
\fIcolor_pair\fP
.PP
The \fBsetcchar\fP function initializes the location pointed to by \fIwcval\fP
by using:
.TP 5
-
The character attributes in
\fIattrs\fP
.TP 5
-
The color pair in
\fIcolor_pair\fP
.TP 5
-
The wide-character string pointed to by \fIwch\fP.
The string must be L'\\0' terminated,
contain at most one character with strictly positive width,
which must be the first,
and contain no characters of negative width.
.SH NOTES
.PP
The \fIopts\fP argument is reserved for future use.
Currently, an application must provide a null pointer as \fIopts\fP.
.PP
The \fIwcval\fP argument may be a value generated by a call to
\fBsetcchar\fP or by a function that has a \fBcchar_t\fP output argument.
If \fIwcval\fP is constructed by any other means, the effect is unspecified.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.PP
When \fIwch\fP is a null pointer,
\fBgetcchar\fP returns the number of wide characters referenced by
\fIwcval\fP, including the null terminator.
.PP
When \fIwch\fP is not a null pointer,
\fBgetcchar\fP returns \fBOK\fP upon successful completion,
and \fBERR\fP otherwise.
.PP
Upon successful completion, \fBsetcchar\fP returns \fBOK\fP.
Otherwise, it returns \fBERR\fP.

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
