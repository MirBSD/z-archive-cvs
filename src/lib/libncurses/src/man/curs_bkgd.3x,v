.SH NAME
\fBbkgdset\fR, \fBwbkgdset\fR,
\fBbkgd\fR, \fBwbkgd\fR,
\fBgetbkgd\fR - \fBcurses\fR window background manipulation routines
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR
.PP
\fBvoid bkgdset(chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBvoid wbkgdset(WINDOW *win, chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBint bkgd(chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBint wbkgd(WINDOW *win, chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBchtype getbkgd(WINDOW *win);\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBbkgdset\fR and \fBwbkgdset\fR routines manipulate the
background of the named window.
The window background is a \fBchtype\fR consisting of
any combination of attributes (i.e., rendition) and a character.
The attribute part of the background is combined (OR'ed) with all non-blank
characters that are written into the window with \fBwaddch\fR.  Both
the character and attribute parts of the background are combined with
the blank characters.  The background becomes a property of the
character and moves with the character through any scrolling and
insert/delete line/character operations.
.PP
To the extent possible on a particular terminal,
the attribute part of the background is displayed
as the graphic rendition of the character put on the screen.
.PP
The \fBbkgd\fR and \fBwbkgd\fR functions
set the background property of the current or specified window
and then apply this setting to every character position in that window:
.PP
.RS
The rendition of every character on the screen is changed to
the new background rendition.
.PP
Wherever the former background character
appears, it is changed to the new background character.
.RE
.PP
The \fBgetbkgd\fR function returns the given window's current background
character/attribute pair.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The routines \fBbkgd\fR and \fBwbkgd\fR return the integer \fBOK\fR.
The SVr4.0 manual says "or a non-negative integer if \fBimmedok\fR is set",
but this appears to be an error.
.SH NOTES
Note that \fBbkgdset\fR and \fBbkgd\fR may be macros.
.SH PORTABILITY
These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
It specifies that \fBbkgd\fR and \fBwbkgd\fR return \fBERR\fR on failure.
but gives no failure conditions.

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
