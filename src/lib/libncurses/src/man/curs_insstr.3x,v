.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines insert a character string
(as many characters as will fit on the line)
before the character under the cursor.
All characters to the right of the cursor are shifted right
with the possibility of the rightmost characters on the line being lost.
The cursor position does not change
(after moving to \fIy\fR, \fIx\fR, if specified).
The functions with \fIn\fR as the last argument
insert a leading substring of at most \fIn\fR characters.
If \fIn\fR<=0, then the entire string is inserted.

Special characters are handled as in \fBaddch\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
All routines that return an integer return \fBERR\fR upon failure and OK (SVr4
specifies only "an integer value other than \fBERR\fR") upon successful
completion, unless otherwise noted in the preceding routine descriptions.
.PP
X/Open defines no error conditions.
In this implementation,
if the window parameter is null or the str parameter is null,
an error is returned.
.SH NOTES
Note that all but \fBwinsnstr\fR may be macros.
.SH PORTABILITY
These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4, which adds
const qualifiers to the arguments.
.LP
The Single Unix Specification, Version 2 states that 
\fBinsnstr\fP and \fBwinsnstr\fP perform wrapping.
This is probably an error, since it makes this group of functions inconsistent.
Also, no implementation of curses documents this inconsistency.

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
