.SH NAME
\fBwresize\fR - resize a curses window
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR

\fBint wresize(WINDOW *win, int lines, int columns);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBwresize\fR function reallocates storage for an \fBncurses\fR
window to adjust its dimensions to the specified values.
If either dimension is larger than the current values, the
window's data is filled with blanks that have the current background rendition
(as set by \fBwbkgndset\fR) merged into them.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The function returns the integer \fBERR\fR upon failure and \fBOK\fR on success.
It will fail if either of the dimensions less than or equal to zero,
or if an error occurs while (re)allocating memory for the window.
.SH NOTES
The only restriction placed on the dimensions is that they be greater than zero.
The dimensions are not compared to \fBcurses\fR screen dimensions to
simplify the logic of \fBresizeterm\fR.
The caller must ensure that the window's dimensions fit within the
actual screen dimensions.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBresizeterm\fR(3X).
.SH AUTHOR
Thomas Dickey (from an equivalent function written in 1988 for BSD curses).

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
