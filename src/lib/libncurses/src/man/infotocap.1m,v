.SH NAME
\fBinfotocap\fR - convert a \fIterminfo\fR description into a \fItermcap\fR description
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBinfotocap\fR [\fB-v\fR\fIn\fR \fIwidth\fR]  [\fB-V\fR] [\fB-1\fR] [\fB-w\fR \fIwidth\fR] \fIfile\fR . . .
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBinfotocap\fR looks in \fIfile\fR for \fBterminfo\fR descriptions.  For each
one found, an equivalent \fBtermcap\fR description is written to standard
output.  Terminfo \fBuse\fR capabilities are translated directly to termcap
\fBtc\fR capabilities.
.TP 5
\fB-v\fR
print out tracing information on standard error as the program runs.
.TP 5
\fB-V\fR
print out the version of the program in use on standard error and exit.
.TP 5
\fB-1\fR
cause the fields to print out one to a line.  Otherwise, the fields
will be printed several to a line to a maximum width of 60
characters.
.TP 5
\fB-w\fR
change the output to \fIwidth\fR characters.
.SH FILES
.TP 20
\*d
Compiled terminal description database.
.SH NOTES
This utility is actually a link to \fItic\fR(1M), running in \fI-C\fR mode.
You can use other \fItic\fR options such as \fB-f\fR and  \fB-x\fR.

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
