.TH curs_scanw 3X ""
.SH NAME
\fBscanw\fR,
\fBwscanw\fR,
\fBmvscanw\fR,
\fBmvwscanw\fR,
\fBvwscanw\fR, \fBvw_scanw\fR - convert formatted input from a \fBcurses\fR window
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR

\fBint scanw(char *fmt, ...);\fR
.br
\fBint wscanw(WINDOW *win, char *fmt, ...);\fR
.br
\fBint mvscanw(int y, int x, char *fmt, ...);\fR
.br
\fBint mvwscanw(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, char *fmt, ...);\fR
.br
\fBint vw_scanw(WINDOW *win, char *fmt, va_list varglist);\fR
.br
\fBint vwscanw(WINDOW *win, char *fmt, va_list varglist);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBscanw\fR, \fBwscanw\fR and \fBmvscanw\fR routines are analogous to
\fBscanf\fR [see \fBscanf\fR(3S)].  The effect of these routines is as though
\fBwgetstr\fR were called on the window, and the resulting line used as input
for \fBsscanf\fR(3).  Fields which do not map to a variable in the \fIfmt\fR
field are lost.

The \fBvwscanw\fR and \fBvw_scanw\fR routines are analogous to \fBvscanf\fR.
They perform a \fBwscanw\fR using a variable argument list.
The third argument is a \fIva_list\fR,
a pointer to a list of arguments, as defined in \fB<stdarg.h>\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUE
\fBvwscanw\fR returns \fBERR\fR on failure and an integer equal to the
number of fields scanned on success.

Applications may use the return value from the \fBscanw\fR, \fBwscanw\fR,
\fBmvscanw\fR and \fBmvwscanw\fR routines to determine the number of fields
which were mapped in the call.
.SH PORTABILITY
The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.  The function
\fBvwscanw\fR is marked TO BE WITHDRAWN, and is to be replaced by a function
\fBvw_scanw\fR using the \fB<stdarg.h>\fR interface.
The Single Unix Specification, Version 2 states that
\fBvw_scanw\fR  is preferred to \fBvwscanw\fR since the latter requires
including \fB<varargs.h>\fR, which
cannot be used in the same file as \fB<stdarg.h>\fR.
This implementation uses \fB<stdarg.h>\fR for both, because that header
is included in \fB<curses.h\fR>.
.LP
Both XSI and The Single Unix Specification, Version 2 state that these
functions return ERR or OK.
Since the underlying \fBscanf\fR can return the number of items scanned,
and the SVr4 code was documented to use this feature,
this is probably an editing error which was introduced in XSI,
rather than being done intentionally.
Portable applications should only test if the return value is ERR,
since the OK value (zero) is likely to be misleading.
One possible way to get useful results would be to use a "%n" conversion
at the end of the format string to ensure that something was processed.

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
