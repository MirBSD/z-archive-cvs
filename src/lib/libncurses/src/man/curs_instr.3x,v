.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines return a string of characters in \fIstr\fR, extracted starting
at the current cursor position in the named window.
Attributes are stripped from the characters.  The four
functions with \fIn\fR as the last argument return a leading substring at most
\fIn\fR characters long (exclusive of the trailing NUL).
.SH RETURN VALUE
All of the functions return \fBERR\fR upon failure,
or the number of characters actually read into the string.
.PP
X/Open defines no error conditions.
In this implementation,
if the window parameter is null or the str parameter is null,
a zero is returned.
.SH NOTES
Note that all routines except \fBwinnstr\fR may be macros.
.SH PORTABILITY
SVr4 does not
document whether a length limit includes or excludes the trailing NUL.
.PP
The ncurses library extends the XSI description by allowing a negative
value for \fIn\fR.
In this case, the functions return the string ending at the right margin.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X).

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
