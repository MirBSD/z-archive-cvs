.SH NAME
\fBmitem_new\fR - create and destroy menu items
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <menu.h>\fR
.br
ITEM *new_item(const char *name, const char *description);
.br
int free_item(ITEM *item);
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBnew_item\fR allocates a new item and initializes it from the
\fBname\fR and \fBdescription\fR pointers. Please notice that the item stores
only the pointers to the name and description. Those pointers must be valid
during the lifetime of the item. So you should be very careful with names
or descriptions allocated on the stack of some routines.
.br
The function \fBfree_item\fR de-allocates an item. Please notice that it
is the responsibility of the application to release the memory for the
name or the description of the item.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The function \fBnew_item\fR returns \fBNULL\fR on error.

The function \fBfree_item\fR returns one of the following:
.TP 5
\fBE_OK\fR
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
\fBE_SYSTEM_ERROR\fR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR).
.TP 5
\fBE_BAD_ARGUMENT\fR
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
\fBE_CONNECTED\fR
Item is connected to a menu.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X), \fBmenu\fR(3X).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<menu.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V menu library.  They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
.SH AUTHORS
Juergen Pfeifer.  Manual pages and adaptation for new curses by Eric
S. Raymond.

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
