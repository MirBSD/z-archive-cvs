.TH curs_beep 3X ""
.SH NAME
\fBbeep\fR, \fBflash\fR - \fBcurses\fR bell and screen flash routines
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR
.PP
\fBint beep(void);\fR
.br
\fBint flash(void);\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBbeep\fR and \fBflash\fR routines are used to alert the terminal user.
The routine \fBbeep\fR sounds an audible alarm on the terminal, if possible;
otherwise it flashes the screen (visible bell).  The routine \fBflash\fR
flashes the screen, and if that is not possible, sounds the alert.  If neither
alert is possible, nothing happens.  Nearly all terminals have an audible alert
(bell or beep), but only some can flash the screen.
.SH RETURN VALUE
These routines return \fBOK\fR if they succeed in beeping or flashing,
\fBERR\fR otherwise.
.SH EXTENSIONS
SVr4's beep and flash routines always returned \fBOK\fR, so it was not
possible to tell when the beep or flash failed.
.SH PORTABILITY
These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
Like SVr4, it specifies that they always return \fBOK\fR.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X)

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
