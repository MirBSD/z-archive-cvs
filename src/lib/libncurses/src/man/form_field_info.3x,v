.TH form_field_info 3X ""
.SH NAME
\fBform_field_info\fR - retrieve field characteristics
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fR
.br
int field_info(const FIELD *field, int *rows, int *cols,
              int *frow, int *fcol, int *nrow, int *nbuf);
.br
int dynamic_field_info(const FIELD *field, int *rows, int *cols, int *max);
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBfield_info\fR returns the sizes and other attributes passed in
to the field at its creation time.  The attributes are: height, width, row of
upper-left corner, column of upper-left corner, number off-screen rows, and
number of working buffers.
.PP
The function \fBdynamic_field_info\fR returns the actual size of the field, and
its maximum possible size.  If the field has no size limit, the location
addressed by the third argument will be set to 0.
A field can be made dynamic
by turning off the \fBO_STATIC\fR option with \fBfield_opts_off\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUE
These routines return one of the following:
.TP 5
\fBE_OK\fR
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
\fBE_SYSTEM_ERROR\fR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR).
.TP 5
\fBE_BAD_ARGUMENT\fR
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X) and related pages whose names begin "form_" for detailed
descriptions of the entry points.
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
.PP
A null (zero pointer) is accepted for any of the return values,
to ignore that value.
Not all implementations allow this, e.g., Solaris 2.7 does not.
.SH AUTHORS
Juergen Pfeifer.  Manual pages and adaptation for new curses by Eric
S. Raymond.

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
