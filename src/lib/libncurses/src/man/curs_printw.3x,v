.SH NAME
\fBprintw\fR,
\fBwprintw\fR,
\fBmvprintw\fR,
\fBmvwprintw\fR,
\fBvwprintw\fR, \fBvw_printw\fR - print formatted output in \fBcurses\fR windows
.ad
.hy
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR

\fBint printw(const char *fmt, ...);\fR
.br
\fBint wprintw(WINDOW *win, const char *fmt, ...);\fR
.br
\fBint mvprintw(int y, int x, const char *fmt, ...);\fR
.br
\fBint mvwprintw(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, const char *fmt, ...);\fR
.br
\fBint vwprintw(WINDOW *win, const char *fmt, va_list varglist);\fR
.br
\fBint vw_printw(WINDOW *win, const char *fmt, va_list varglist);\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBprintw\fR, \fBwprintw\fR, \fBmvprintw\fR and \fBmvwprintw\fR
routines are analogous to \fBprintf\fR [see \fBprintf\fR(3S)].  In
effect, the string that would be output by \fBprintf\fR is output
instead as though \fBwaddstr\fR were used on the given window.

The \fBvwprintw\fR and \fBwv_printw\fR routines are analogous
to \fBvprintf\fR [see \fBprintf\fR(3S)]
and perform a \fBwprintw\fR using a variable argument list.
The third argument is a \fBva_list\fR, a pointer to a
list of arguments, as defined in \fB<stdarg.h>\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Routines that return an integer return \fBERR\fR upon failure and \fBOK\fR
(SVr4 only specifies "an integer value other than \fBERR\fR") upon successful
completion.
.PP
X/Open defines no error conditions.
In this implementation,
an error may be returned if it cannot allocate enough memory for the
buffer used to format the results.
It will return an error if the window pointer is null.
.SH PORTABILITY
The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.  The function
\fBvwprintw\fR is marked TO BE WITHDRAWN, and is to be replaced by a function
\fBvw_printw\fR using the \fB<stdarg.h>\fR interface.
The Single Unix Specification, Version 2 states that
\fBvw_printw\fR  is preferred to \fBvwprintw\fR since the latter requires
including \fB<varargs.h>\fR, which
cannot be used in the same file as \fB<stdarg.h>\fR.
This implementation uses \fB<stdarg.h>\fR for both, because that header
is included in \fB<curses.h\fR>.

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
