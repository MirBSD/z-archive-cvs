.SH NAME
\fBtouchwin\fR,

\fBuntouchwin\fR,
\fBwtouchln\fR,
\fBis_linetouched\fR,
\fBis_wintouched\fR - \fBcurses\fR refresh control routines

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR
.br
\fBint touchwin(WINDOW *win);\fR
.br
\fBint touchline(WINDOW *win, int start, int count);\fR
.br
\fBint untouchwin(WINDOW *win);\fR
.br
\fBint wtouchln(WINDOW *win, int y, int n, int changed);\fR
.br
\fBbool is_linetouched(WINDOW *win, int line);\fR
.br
\fBbool is_wintouched(WINDOW *win);\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBtouchwin\fR and \fBtouchline\fR routines throw away all
optimization information about which parts of the window have been
touched, by pretending that the entire window has been drawn on.  This
is sometimes necessary when using overlapping windows, since a change
to one window affects the other window, but the records of which lines
have been changed in the other window do not reflect the change.  The
routine \fBtouchline\fR only pretends that \fIcount\fR lines have been
changed, beginning with line \fIstart\fR.

The \fBuntouchwin\fR routine marks all lines in the window as unchanged since
the last call to \fBwrefresh\fR.

The \fBwtouchln\fR routine makes \fIn\fR lines in the window, starting
at line \fIy\fR, look as if they have (\fIchanged\fR\fB=1\fR) or have
not (\fIchanged\fR\fB=0\fR) been changed since the last call to
\fBwrefresh\fR.

The \fBis_linetouched\fR and \fBis_wintouched\fR routines return
\fBTRUE\fR if the specified line/window was modified since the last
call to \fBwrefresh\fR; otherwise they return \fBFALSE\fR.  In
addition, \fBis_linetouched\fR returns \fBERR\fR if \fIline\fR is not
valid for the given window.
.SH RETURN VALUE
All routines return the integer \fBERR\fR upon failure and an integer value
other than \fBERR\fR upon successful completion, unless otherwise noted in the
preceding routine descriptions.
.PP
X/Open does not define any error conditions.
In this implementation
.RS
.TP 5
\fBis_linetouched\fP
returns an error 
if the window pointer is null, or
if the line number is outside the window.
Note that ERR is distinct from TRUE and FALSE, which are the normal return values of this function.
.TP 5
\fBwtouchln\fP
returns an error 
if the window pointer is null, or
if the line number is outside the window.
.RE
.SH PORTABILITY
The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.

Some historic curses implementations had, as an undocumented feature, the
ability to do the equivalent of \fBclearok(..., 1)\fR by saying
\fBtouchwin(stdscr)\fR or \fBclear(stdscr)\fR.  This will not work under
ncurses.
.SH NOTES
Note that all routines except \fBwtouchln\fR may be macros.
.SH SEE ALSO

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
