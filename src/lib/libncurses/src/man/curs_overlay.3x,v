.SH NAME
\fBoverlay\fR,
\fBoverwrite\fR,
\fBcopywin\fR - overlay and manipulate overlapped \fBcurses\fR windows
.ad
.hy
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR

\fBint overlay(const WINDOW *srcwin, WINDOW *dstwin);\fR
.br
\fBint overwrite(const WINDOW *srcwin, WINDOW *dstwin);\fR
.br
\fBint copywin(const WINDOW *srcwin, WINDOW *dstwin, int sminrow,\fR
      \fBint smincol, int dminrow, int dmincol, int dmaxrow,\fR
      \fBint dmaxcol, int overlay);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBoverlay\fR and \fBoverwrite\fR routines overlay \fIsrcwin\fR on
top of \fIdstwin\fR.  \fIscrwin\fR and \fIdstwin\fR are not required
to be the same size; only text where the two windows overlap is
copied.  The difference is that \fBoverlay\fR is non-destructive
(blanks are not copied) whereas \fBoverwrite\fR is destructive.

The \fBcopywin\fR routine provides a finer granularity of control over the
\fBoverlay\fR and \fBoverwrite\fR routines.  Like in the \fBprefresh\fR
routine, a rectangle is specified in the destination window, (\fIdminrow\fR,
\fIdmincol\fR) and (\fIdmaxrow\fR, \fIdmaxcol\fR), and the upper-left-corner
coordinates of the source window, (\fIsminrow\fR, \fIsmincol\fR).  If the
argument \fIoverlay\fR is \fBtrue\fR, then copying is non-destructive, as in
\fBoverlay\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Routines that return an integer return \fBERR\fR upon failure, and \fBOK\fR
(SVr4 only specifies "an integer value other than \fBERR\fR") upon successful
completion.
.PP
X/Open defines no error conditions.
In this implementation,
\fBcopywin\fP,
\fBoverlay\fP and \fBoverwrite\fP return an error
if either of the window pointers are null, or
if some part of the window would be placed off-screen.
.SH NOTES
Note that \fBoverlay\fR and \fBoverwrite\fR may be macros.
.SH PORTABILITY
The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions (adding the const
qualifiers).  It further specifies their behavior in the presence of characters
with multibyte renditions (not yet supported in this implementation).

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
