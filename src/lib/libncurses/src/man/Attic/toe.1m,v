.SH NAME
\fBtoe\fR - table of (terminfo) entries
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtoe\fR [\fB-v\fR[\fIn\fR]] [\fB-huUV\fR] \fIfile...\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
With no options, \fBtoe\fR lists all available terminal types by primary name
with descriptions.  File arguments specify the directories to be scanned; if no
such arguments are given, your default terminfo directory is scanned.  If you
also specify the \fB-h\fR option, a directory header will be issued as each
directory is entered.
.PP
There are other options intended for use by terminfo file maintainers:
.TP
\fB-u\fR \fIfile\fR
says to issue a report on dependencies in the given file. This report condenses
the `use' relation: each line consists of the primary name of a terminal that
has use capabilities, followed by a colon, followed by the
whitespace-separated primary names of all terminals which occur in those use
capabilities, followed by a newline
.TP
\fB-U\fR \fIfile\fR
says to issue a report on reverse dependencies in the given file. This report
reverses the `use' relation: each line consists of the primary name of a
terminal that occurs in use capabilities, followed by a colon, followed by the
whitespace-separated primary names of all terminals which depend on it,
followed by a newline.
.TP
\fB-v\fR\fIn\fR
specifies that (verbose) output be written to standard error trace
information showing \fBtoe\fR's progress.  The optional integer
\fIn\fR is a number from 1 to 10, interpreted as for \fBtic\fR(1).
.TP 5
\fB-V\fR
reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and exits.
.SH FILES

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
