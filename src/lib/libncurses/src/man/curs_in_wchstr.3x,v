.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions return an array of complex characters in \fIwchstr\fR,
starting at the current cursor position in the named window.
Attributes (rendition) are stored with the characters.
.PP
The
\fBin_wchnstr\fR,
\fBmvin_wchnstr\fR,
\fBmvwin_wchnstr\fR
and
\fBwin_wchnstr\fR
fill the array
with at most
\fIn\fR
\fBcchar_t\fR
elements.
.br
.SH NOTES
Note that all routines except
\fBwin_wchnstr\fR
may be
macros.
.PP
Reading a line that overflows the array pointed to by
\fIwchstr\fR
with
\fBin_wchstr\fR,
\fBmvin_wchstr\fR,
\fBmvwin_wchstr\fR
or
\fBwin_wchstr\fR
causes undefined results. Therefore, the use of
\fBin_wchnstr\fR,
\fBmvin_wchnstr\fR,
\fBmvwin_wchnstr\fR, or
\fBwin_wchnstr\fR
is recommended.
.SH RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, these functions return
\fBOK\fR.
Otherwise, they return
\fBERR\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
The XSI Curses defines no error conditions.
This implementation checks for null pointers,
returning ERR in that case.
.SH SEE ALSO
Functions:
\fBcurses\fR(3X),
\fBcurs_in_wch\fR(3X),
\fBcurs_instr\fR(3X),

@remove "new" libncurses:
* libncurses can do about the same things as our current libcurses,
  with about the same bugs regarding japanese character positions
  and cursor positioning in an uxterm (and lynx width bugs)
* libncurses cannot, however, make use of terminfo.db and neither
  do I want to restrict it to termcap nor do we want the zillions
  of files under /usr/share/terminfo like the clueless leenocksers
  (except if we had reiserfs)
* libncursesw suffers from the same limitations as libncurses
* libncursesw does not correctly display any text in an uxterm
  except for some links in lynx (but not ordinary text) - this
  might have something to do with "fancy curses" though
* libmenu has not yet been ported, is easy though
* libpanel neither

thus the developers decided it's not worth to continue
investing work into it until these flaws are found and
fixed

furthermore, upgrading our curses is not easily possible,
nor is it possible at all to get hands on a distfile of
ncurses-5.2-20010224 so we can't diff against the vendor;
thus millert@@openbsd.org is the only person who can solve
this dilemma, I think
