Subject: sendmail 8.14.2 available

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Sendmail, Inc., and the Sendmail Consortium announce the availability
of sendmail 8.14.2 which fixes some problems, e.g.,

- - an important bug in the milter function smfi_chgfrom() which could
  cause the loss of a message body.
- - the handling of queued messages with 8 bit characters in From:
  or To: header which could be "mistaken" for internal control
  characters during a queue run and trigger various consistency checks.
- - the handling of lines longer than MAXLINE-1 characters in certain
  cases.

A complete list of changes can be found in the release notes (see
below).

Please send bug reports and general feedback to one of the addresses
listed at: http://www.sendmail.org/email-addresses.html

The version can be found at

			SENDMAIL RELEASE NOTES
      $Id: RELEASE_NOTES,v 8.1909 2007/10/31 16:04:13 ca Exp $


This listing shows the version of the sendmail binary, the version
of the sendmail configuration files, the date of release, and a
summary of the changes in that release.

8.14.2/8.14.2	2007/11/01
	If a message was queued and it contained 8 bit characters in
		a From: or To: header, then those characters could be
		"mistaken" for internal control characters during a queue
		run and trigger various consistency checks.  Problem
		noted by Neil Rickert of Northern Illinois University.
	If MaxMimeHeaderLength is set to a value greater than 0 (which
		it is by default) then even if the Linelimit parameter
		is 0, sendmail corrupted in the non-transfer-encoding
		case every MAXLINE-1 characters.  Patch from John Gardiner
		Myers of Proofpoint.
	Setting the suboption DeliveryMode for DaemonPortOptions did not
		work in earlier 8.14 versions.
	Note: DeliveryMode=interactive is silently converted to
		background if a milter can reject or delete a recipient.
		Prior to 8.14 this happened only if milter could delete
		recipients.
	ClientRate should trigger when the limit was exceeded (as
		documented), not when it was reached.  Patch from
		John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	Force a queue run for -qGqueuegroup even if no runners are
		specified (R=0) and forking (F=f) is requested.
	When multiple results are requested for a DNS map lookup
		(-z and -Z), return only those that are relevant for
		the query (not also those in the "additional section".)
	If the message transfer time to sendmail (when acting as server)
		exceeds Timeout.queuewarn or Timeout.queuereturn and
		the message is refused (by a milter), sendmail previously
		created a delivery status notification (DSN).  Patch
		from Doug Heath of The Hertz Corporation.
	A code change in Cyrus-SASL 2.1.22 for sasl_decode64() requires
		the MTA to deal with some input (i.e., "=") itself.
		Problem noted by Eliot Lear.
	sendmail counted a delivery as successful if PIPELINING is
		compiled in but not offered by the server and the
		delivery failed temporarily.  Patch from Werner Wiethege.
	If getting the result of an LDAP query times out then close the
		map so it will be reopened on the next lookup.  This
		should help "failover" configurations that specify more
		than one LDAP server.
	If check_compat returns $#discard then a "savemail panic" could
		be triggered under some circumstances (e.g., requiring
		a system which does not have the compile time flag
		HASFLOCK set). Based on patch by Motonori Nakamura
		of National Institute of Informatics, Japan.
	If a milter rejected a recipient, the count for nrcpts= in the
		logfile entry might have been wrong.  Problem found by
		Petra Humann of TU Dresden.
	If a milter invoked smfi_chgfrom() where ESMTP arguments are not
		NULL, the message body was lost.  Patch from Motonori
		Nakamura of National Institute of Informatics, Japan.
	sendmail(8) had a bogus space in -qGname.  Patch from Peng Haitao.
	CONTRIB: buildvirtuser: Preserve ownership and permissions when
		replacing files.
	CONTRIB: buildvirtuser: Skip dot-files (e.g., .cvsignore) when
		reading the /etc/mail/virtusers/ directory.
	CONTRIB: buildvirtuser: Emit warnings instead of exiting where
		appropriate.
	LIBMILTER: Fix ABI backwards compatibility so milters compiled
		against an older libmilter.so shared library can use an
		8.14 libmilter.so shared library.
	LIBMILTER: smfi_version() did not properly extract the patchlevel
		from the version number, however, the returned value was
		correct for the current libmilter version.
