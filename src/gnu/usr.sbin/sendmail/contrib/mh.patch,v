Subject: MH-6.8.1/Sendmail 8.X (MH patch) updated
Date: Fri, 03 Sep 1993 14:00:46 -0500
From: Dave Nelson <dcn@@ignatz.acs.depaul.edu>


	This patch will fix the "X-auth..." warnings from the newer
Sendmails (8.X) while continuing to work with the old sendmails.

	I think the following patch will make everyone happy.

	1)  Anybody with MH-6.8.1 can install this.  It doesn't matter
	    what version of sendmail you're running.  It doesn't matter
	    if you're not running sendmail (but it won't fix anything
	    for you).

	2)  No configuration file hacks. If the -client switch is
	    absent (the default), the new sendmails will get an EHLO 
	    using what LocalName() returns as the hostname.  On my systems, 
	    this returns the FQDN.  If the EHLO fails with a result between 
	    500 and 599  and the -client switch is not set, we give up on 
	    sending EHLO/HELO and just go deliver the mail.

	3)  No new configuration options.

	4)  Retains the undocumented -client switch.  One warning:  it
	    is possible using the -client switch to cause the old sendmails
	    to return "I refuse to talk to myself".  You could do this under
	    the old code as well.  This will happen if you claim to be the
	    same system as the sendmail you're sending to is running on.  
	    That's pointless, but possible.  If you do this, just like under
	    the old code, you will get an error.

	5)  If you're running a site with both old and new sendmails, you only
	    have to build MH once.  The code's the same; works with them
	    both.

	If you decide to install this, make sure that you look the patch
over and that you agree with what it is doing.  It works for me, but I
can't test it on every possible combination.  Make sure that it works
before you really install it for your users, if any.  No promises.

	To install this, save this to a file in the mts/sendmail directory.
Feed it to patch.  Patch will ignore the non-patch stuff.  You should have
"mts sendmail/smtp" in your configuration file.  This works with old and
new sendmails.  Using "mts sendmail"  will cause the new sendmails to
print an "X-auth..." warning about who owns the process piping the mail 
message.  I don't know of anyway of getting rid of these.

	mh-config (if necessary), make, make inst-all.


I hope this helps people.
