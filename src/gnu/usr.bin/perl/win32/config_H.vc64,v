 *
 *	    1 = supports declaration of void
 *	    2 = supports arrays of pointers to functions returning void
 *	    4 = supports comparisons between pointers to void functions and
 *		    addresses of void functions
 *	    8 = suports declaration of generic void pointers
 *
 *	The package designer should define VOIDUSED to indicate the requirements
 *	of the package.  This can be done either by #defining VOIDUSED before
 *	including config.h, or by defining defvoidused in Myinit.U.  If the
 *	latter approach is taken, only those flags will be tested.  If the
 *	level of void support necessary is not present, defines void to int.
