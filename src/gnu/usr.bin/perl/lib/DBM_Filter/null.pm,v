=head1 NAME

DBM_Filter::null -- DBM Filter to force null termination

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use SDBM_File; # or DB_File, or GDBM_File, or NDBM_File, or ODBM_File
    use DBM_Filter ;

    $db = tie %hash, ...
    $db->Filter_Push('null');
    
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This filter ensures that all data written to the DBM file is null
terminated. This is useful when you have a perl script that needs
to interoperate with a DBM file that a C program also uses. A fairly
common issue is for the C application to include the terminating null
in a string when it writes to the DBM file. This filter will ensure that
all data written to the DBM file can be read by the C application.
