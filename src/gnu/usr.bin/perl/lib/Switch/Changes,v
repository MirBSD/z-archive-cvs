	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18



2.00	Mon Jan  8 17:12:20 2001

	- Complete revamp (including syntactic and semantic changes)
	  in line with proposed Perl 6 semantics.


2.01	Tue Jan  9 07:19:02 2001

	- Fixed infinite loop problem under 5.6.0 caused by change
	  in goto semantics between 5.00503 and 5.6.0
	  (thanks Scott!)
	  


2.02	Thu Apr 26 12:01:06 2001

	- Fixed unwarranted whitespace squeezing before quotelikes
	  (thanks Ray)

	- Fixed pernicious bug that cause switch to fail to recognize
	  certain complex switch values


2.03	Tue May 15 09:34:11 2001

	- Fixed bug in 'fallthrough' specifications.

	- Silenced gratuitous warnings for undefined values as
	  switch or case values


2.04	Mon Jul 30 13:17:35 2001

	- Suppressed 'undef value' warning under -w (thanks Michael)

	- Added support for Perl 6 given..when syntax


2.05	Mon Sep  3 08:13:25 2001

	- Changed licence for inclusion in core distribution

	- Added new test file for non-fallthrough and nested switches


2.06	Wed Nov 14 16:18:54 2001

	- Fixed parsing of ternary operators in Switch'ed source code
	  (at the expense of no longer correctly parsing ?...? regexes)
	  (thanks Mark)

	- Fixed the parsing of embedded POD (thanks Brent)

	- Fixed bug encountered when -s or -m file test used (thanks Jochen)


2.07	Wed May 15 15:19:28 2002

	- Corified tests

	- Updated "Perl6" syntax to reflect current design
	  (as far as possible -- can't eliminate need to parenthesize
	  variables, since they're ambiguous in Perl 5)


2.09	Wed Jun 12 22:13:30 2002

	- Removed spurious debugging statement


2.10	Mon Dec 29

	- Introduce the "default" keyword for the Perl 6 syntax
