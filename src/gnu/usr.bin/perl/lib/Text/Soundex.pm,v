=head1 NAME

Text::Soundex - Implementation of the Soundex Algorithm as Described by Knuth

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Text::Soundex;

  $code = soundex $string;            # get soundex code for a string
  @@codes = soundex @@list;             # get list of codes for list of strings

  # set value to be returned for strings without soundex code

  $soundex_nocode = 'Z000';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements the soundex algorithm as described by Donald Knuth
in Volume 3 of B<The Art of Computer Programming>.  The algorithm is
intended to hash words (in particular surnames) into a small space using a
simple model which approximates the sound of the word when spoken by an English
speaker.  Each word is reduced to a four character string, the first
character being an upper case letter and the remaining three being digits.

If there is no soundex code representation for a string then the value of
C<$soundex_nocode> is returned.  This is initially set to C<undef>, but
many people seem to prefer an I<unlikely> value like C<Z000>
(how unlikely this is depends on the data set being dealt with.)  Any value
can be assigned to C<$soundex_nocode>.

In scalar context C<soundex> returns the soundex code of its first
argument, and in list context a list is returned in which each element is the 
soundex code for the corresponding argument passed to C<soundex> e.g.

  @@codes = soundex qw(Mike Stok);

leaves C<@@codes> containing C<('M200', 'S320')>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Knuth's examples of various names and the soundex codes they map to
are listed below:

  Euler, Ellery -> E460
  Gauss, Ghosh -> G200
  Hilbert, Heilbronn -> H416
  Knuth, Kant -> K530
  Lloyd, Ladd -> L300
  Lukasiewicz, Lissajous -> L222

so:

  $code = soundex 'Knuth';              # $code contains 'K530'
  @@list = soundex qw(Lloyd Gauss);	# @@list contains 'L300', 'G200'

=head1 LIMITATIONS

As the soundex algorithm was originally used a B<long> time ago in the US
it considers only the English alphabet and pronunciation.

As it is mapping a large space (arbitrary length strings) onto a small
space (single letter plus 3 digits) no inference can be made about the
similarity of two strings which end up with the same soundex code.  For 
example, both C<Hilbert> and C<Heilbronn> end up with a soundex code
of C<H416>.

=head1 AUTHOR

This code was implemented by Mike Stok (C<stok@@cybercom.net>) from the 
description given by Knuth.  Ian Phillipps (C<ian@@pipex.net>) and Rich Pinder 
(C<rpinder@@hsc.usc.edu>) supplied ideas and spotted mistakes.
