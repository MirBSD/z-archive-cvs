#   Suppose you overfill the defer buffer by so much that the memory
#   limit is also exceeded.  You'll go into _splice to prepare to
#   write out the defer buffer, and _splice will call _fetch, which
#   will then try to flush the read cache---but the read cache is
#   already empty, so you're stuck in an infinite loop.
#
# Five seconds should be plenty of time for it to complete if it works.
