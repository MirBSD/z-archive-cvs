=head1 NAME

FindBin - Locate directory of original perl script

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use FindBin;
 use lib "$FindBin::Bin/../lib";

 or

 use FindBin qw($Bin);
 use lib "$Bin/../lib";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Locates the full path to the script bin directory to allow the use
of paths relative to the bin directory.

This allows a user to setup a directory tree for some software with
directories E<lt>rootE<gt>/bin and E<lt>rootE<gt>/lib and then the above example will allow
the use of modules in the lib directory without knowing where the software
tree is installed.

If perl is invoked using the B<-e> option or the perl script is read from
C<STDIN> then FindBin sets both C<$Bin> and C<$RealBin> to the current
directory.

=head1 EXPORTABLE VARIABLES

 $Bin         - path to bin directory from where script was invoked
 $Script      - basename of script from which perl was invoked
 $RealBin     - $Bin with all links resolved
 $RealScript  - $Script with all links resolved

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

If there are two modules using C<FindBin> from different directories
under the same interpreter, this won't work. Since C<FindBin> uses a
C<BEGIN> block, it'll be executed only once, and only the first caller
will get it right. This is a problem under mod_perl and other persistent
Perl environments, where you shouldn't use this module. Which also means
that you should avoid using C<FindBin> in modules that you plan to put
on CPAN. To make sure that C<FindBin> will work is to call the C<again>
function:

  use FindBin;
  FindBin::again(); # or FindBin->again;

In former versions of FindBin there was no C<again> function. The
workaround was to force the C<BEGIN> block to be executed again:

  delete $INC{'FindBin.pm'};
  require FindBin;

=head1 KNOWN BUGS

If perl is invoked as

   perl filename

and I<filename> does not have executable rights and a program called I<filename>
exists in the users C<$ENV{PATH}> which satisfies both B<-x> and B<-T> then FindBin
assumes that it was invoked via the C<$ENV{PATH}>.

Workaround is to invoke perl as

 perl ./filename

=head1 AUTHORS

FindBin is supported as part of the core perl distribution. Please send bug
reports to E<lt>F<perlbug@@perl.org>E<gt> using the perlbug program included with perl.
