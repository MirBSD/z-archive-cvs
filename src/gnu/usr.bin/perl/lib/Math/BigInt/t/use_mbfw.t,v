# the replacement lib can handle the lib statement, but it could also ignore
# it completely, for instance, when it is a 100% replacement for BigInt, but
# doesn't know the concept of alternative libs. But it still needs to cope
# with "lib => ". SubClass does record it, so we test here essential if
# BigFloat hands the lib properly down, any more is outside out testing reach.
