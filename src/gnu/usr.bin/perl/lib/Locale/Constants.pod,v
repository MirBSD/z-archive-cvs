=head1 NAME

Locale::Constants - constants for Locale codes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Locale::Constants;
    
    $codeset = LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Locale::Constants> defines symbols which are used in
the four modules from the Locale-Codes distribution:

	Locale::Language
	Locale::Country
	Locale::Currency
	Locale::Script

B<Note:> at the moment only Locale::Country and Locale::Script
support more than one code set.

The symbols defined are used to specify which codes you
want to be used:

	LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2
	LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_3
	LOCALE_CODE_NUMERIC

You shouldn't have to C<use> this module directly yourself -
it is used by the three Locale modules, which in turn export
the symbols.

=head1 KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

None at the moment.
