# as of 2.09 on win32 Storable w/threads dies with "free to wrong
# pool" since it uses the same context for different threads. since
# win32 perl implementation allocates a different memory pool for each
# thread using the a memory pool from one thread to allocate memory
# for another thread makes win32 perl very unhappy
#
# but the problem exists everywhere, not only on win32 perl , it's
# just hard to catch it deterministically - since the same context is
# used if two or more threads happen to change the state of the
# context in the middle of the operation, and those operations aren't
# atomic per thread, bad things including data loss and corrupted data
# can happen.
#
# this has been solved in 2.10 by adding a Storable::CLONE which calls
# Storable::init_perinterp() to create a new context for each new
# thread when it starts
