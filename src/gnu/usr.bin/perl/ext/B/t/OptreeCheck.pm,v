=head1 NAME

OptreeCheck - check optrees as rendered by B::Concise

=head1 SYNOPSIS

OptreeCheck supports regression testing of perl's parser, optimizer,
bytecode generator, via a single function: checkOptree(%args).  It
invokes B::Concise upon sample code, and checks that it 'agrees' with
reference renderings.

  checkOptree (
    name   => "test-name',	# optional, (synth from others)

    # 2 kinds of code-under-test: must provide 1
    code   => sub {my $a},	# coderef, or source (wrapped and evald)
    prog   => 'sort @@a',	# run in subprocess, aka -MO=Concise

    bcopts => '-exec',		# $opt or \@@opts, passed to BC::compile
    # errs   => '.*',		# match against any emitted errs, -w warnings
    # skip => 1,		# skips test
    # todo => 'excuse',		# anticipated failures
    # fail => 1			# force fail (by redirecting result)
    # debug => 1,		# turns on regex debug for match test !!
    # retry => 1		# retry with debug on test failure

    expect => <<'EOT_EOT', expect_nt => <<'EONT_EONT' );
 # 1  <;> nextstate(main 45 optree.t:23) v
 # 2  <0> padsv[$a:45,46] M/LVINTRO
 # 3  <1> leavesub[1 ref] K/REFC,1

=head1 checkOptree(%in) Overview

optreeCheck() calls getRendering(), which runs code or prog through
B::Concise, and captures its rendering.

It then calls mkCheckRex() to produce a regex which will match the
expected rendering, and fail when it doesn't match.

Finally, it compares the 2; like($rendering,/$regex/,$testname).


=head1 checkOptree(%Args) API

Accepts %Args, with following requirements and actions:

Either code or prog must be present.  prog is some source code, and is
passed through via test.pl:runperl, to B::Concise like this: (bcopts
are fixed up for cmdline)

    './perl -w -MO=Concise,$bcopts_massaged -e $src'

code is a subref, or $src, like above.  If it's not a subref, it's
treated like source-code, is wrapped as a subroutine, and is passed to
B::Concise::compile().

    $subref = eval "sub{$src}";
    B::Concise::compile($subref).

expect and expect_nt are the reference optree renderings.  Theyre
required, except when the code/prog compilation fails.

I suppose I should also explain these more, but they seem obvious.

    # prog   => 'sort @@a',	# run in subprocess, aka -MO=Concise
    # noanchors => 1,		# no /^$/.  needed for 1-liners like above

    # skip => 1,		# skips test
    # todo => 'excuse',		# anticipated failures
    # fail => 1			# fails (by redirecting result)
    # debug => 1,		# turns on regex debug for match test !!
    # retry => 1		# retry with debug on test failure

=head1 Test Philosophy

2 platforms --> 2 reftexts: You want an accurate test, independent of
which platform you're on.  So, two refdata properties, 'expect' and
'expect_nt', carry renderings taken from threaded and non-threaded
builds.  This has several benefits:

 1. native reference data allows closer matching by regex.
 2. samples can be eyeballed to grok t-nt differences.
 3. data can help to validate mkCheckRex() operation.
 4. can develop regexes which accomodate t-nt differences.
 5. can test with both native and cross+converted regexes.

Cross-testing (expect_nt on threaded, expect on non-threaded) exposes
differences in B::Concise output, so mkCheckRex has code to do some
cross-test manipulations.  This area needs more work.

=head1 Test Modes

One consequence of a single-function API is difficulty controlling
test-mode.  Ive chosen for now to use a package hash, %gOpts, to store
test-state.  These properties alter checkOptree() function, either
short-circuiting to selftest, or running a loop that runs the testcase
2^N times, varying conditions each time.  (current N is 2 only).

So Test-mode is controlled with cmdline args, also called options below.
Run with 'help' to see the test-state, and how to change it.

=head2  selftest

This argument invokes runSelftest(), which tests a regex against the
reference renderings that they're made from.  Failure of a regex match
its 'mold' is a strong indicator that mkCheckRex is buggy.

That said, selftest mode currently runs a cross-test too, they're not
completely orthogonal yet.  See below.

=head2 testmode=cross

Cross-testing is purposely creating a T-NT mismatch, looking at the
fallout, and tweaking the regex to deal with it.  Thus tests lead to
'provably' complete understanding of the differences.

The tweaking appears contrary to the 2-refs philosophy, but the tweaks
will be made in conversion-specific code, which (will) handles T->NT
and NT->T separately.  The tweaking is incomplete.

A reasonable 1st step is to add tags to indicate when TonNT or NTonT
is known to fail.  This needs an option to force failure, so the
test.pl reporting mechanics show results to aid the user.

=head2 testmode=native

This is normal mode.  Other valid values are: native, cross, both.

=head2 checkOptree Notes

Accepts test code, renders its optree using B::Concise, and matches that
rendering against a regex built from one of 2 reference-renderings %in data.

The regex is built by mkCheckRex(\%in), which scrubs %in data to
remove match-irrelevancies, such as (args) and [args].  For example,
it strips leading '# ', making it easy to cut-paste new tests into
your test-file, run it, and cut-paste actual results into place.  You
then retest and reedit until all 'errors' are gone.  (now make sure you
haven't 'enshrined' a bug).

name: The test name.  May be augmented by a label, which is built from
important params, and which helps keep names in sync with whats being
tested.'

=head1 mkCheckRex

mkCheckRex receives the full testcase object, and constructs a regex.
1st, it selects a reftxt from either the expect or expect_nt items.

Once selected, the reftext is massaged & converted into a Regex that
accepts 'good' concise renderings, with appropriate input variations,
but is otherwise as strict as possible.  For example, it should *not*
match when opcode flags change, or when optimizations convert an op to
an ex-op.

selection is driven by platform mostly, but also by test-mode, which
rather complicates the code.  this is worsened by the potential need
to make platform specific conversions on the reftext.

=head2 match criteria

Opcode arguments (text within braces) are disregarded for matching
purposes.  This loses some info in 'add[t5]', but greatly simplifys
matching 'nextstate(main 22 (eval 10):1)'.  Besides, we are testing
for regressions, not for complete accuracy.

The regex is anchored by default, but can be suppressed with
'noanchors', allowing 1-liner tests to succeed if opcode is found.

=head1 TEST DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT

This optree regression testing framework needs tests in order to find
bugs.  To that end, OptreeCheck has support for developing new tests,
according to the following model:

 1. write a set of sample code into a single file, one per
    paragraph.  f_map and f_sort in ext/B/t/ are examples.

 2. run OptreeCheck as a program on the file

   ./perl -Ilib ext/B/t/OptreeCheck.pm -w ext/B/t/f_map
   ./perl -Ilib ext/B/t/OptreeCheck.pm -w ext/B/t/f_sort

   gentest reads the sample code, runs each to generate a reference
   rendering, folds this rendering into an optreeCheck() statement,
   and prints it to stdout.

 3. run the output file as above, redirect to files, then rerun on
    same build (for sanity check), and on thread-opposite build.  With
    editor in 1 window, and cmd in other, it's fairly easy to cut-paste
    the gots into the expects, easier than running step 2 on both
    builds then trying to sdiff them together.

=head1 TODO

There's a considerable amount of cruft in the whole arg-handling setup.
I'll replace / strip it before 5.10

Treat %in as a test object, interwork better with Test::*

Refactor mkCheckRex() and selfTest() to isolate the selftest,
crosstest, etc selection mechanics.

improve retry, retrydbg, esp. it's control of eval "use re debug".
This seems to work part of the time, but isn't stable enough.

=head1 CAVEATS

This code is purely for testing core. While checkOptree feels flexible
enough to be stable, the whole selftest framework is subject to change
w/o notice.

OptreeCheck supports 'golden-sample' regression testing of perl's
parser, optimizer, bytecode generator, via a single function:
checkOptree(%in).

It invokes B::Concise upon the sample code, checks that the rendering
'agrees' with the golden sample, and reports mismatches.

Additionally, the module processes @@ARGV (which is typically unused in
the Core test harness), and thus provides a means to run the tests in
various modes.

Errors are reported 3 different ways;

The 1st form is directly from test.pl's like() and unlike().  Note
that this form is used as input, so you can easily cut-paste results
into test-files you are developing.  Just make sure you recognize
insane results, to avoid canonizing them as golden samples.

The 2nd and 3rd forms show only the unexpected results and opcodes.
This is done because it's blindingly tedious to find a single opcode
causing the failure.  2 different ways are done in case one is
unhelpful.

=head1 TestCase Overview

checkOptree(%tc) constructs a testcase object from %tc, and then calls
methods which eventually call test.pl's like() to produce test
results.

=head2 getRendering

getRendering() runs code or prog through B::Concise, and captures its
rendering.  Errors emitted during rendering are checked against
expected errors, and are reported as diagnostics by default, or as
failures if 'report=fail' cmdline-option is given.

prog is run in a sub-shell, with $bcopts passed through. This is the way
to run code intended for main.  The code arg in contrast, is always a
CODEREF, either because it starts that way as an arg, or because it's
wrapped and eval'd as $sub = sub {$code};

=head2 mkCheckRex

mkCheckRex() selects the golden-sample for the threaded-ness of the
platform, and produces a regex which matches the expected rendering,
and fails when it doesn't match.

The regex includes 'workarounds' which accommodate expected rendering
variations. These include:

  string constants		# avoid injection
  line numbers, etc		# args of nexstate()
  hexadecimal-numbers

  pad-slot-assignments		# for 5.8 compat, and testmode=cross
  (map|grep)(start|while)	# for 5.8 compat

=head2 mylike

mylike() calls either unlike() or like(), depending on
expectations.  Mismatch reports are massaged, because the actual
difference can easily be lost in the forest of opcodes.

=head1 checkOptree API and Operation

Since the arg is a hash, the api is wide-open, and this really is
about what elements must be or are in the hash, and what they do.  %tc
is passed to newTestCase(), the ctor, which adds in %proto, a global
prototype object.

=head2 name => STRING

If name property is not provided, it is synthesized from these params:
bcopts, note, prog, code.  This is more convenient than trying to do
it manually.
a51 1
=head2 code or prog
d53 1
a53 1
Either code or prog must be present.
d55 1
a55 1
=head2 prog => $perl_source_string
d57 3
a59 2
prog => $src provides a snippet of code, which is run in a sub-process,
via test.pl:runperl, and through B::Concise like so:
d63 3
a65 1
=head2 code => $perl_source_string || CODEREF
d67 2
a68 3
The $code arg is passed to B::Concise::compile(), and run in-process.
If $code is a string, it's first wrapped and eval'd into a $coderef.
In either case, $coderef is then passed to B::Concise::compile():
d70 2
a71 2
    $subref = eval "sub{$code}";
    $render = B::Concise::compile($subref)->();
d73 1
a73 1
=head2 expect and expect_nt
d75 2
a76 4
expect and expect_nt args are the B<golden-sample> renderings, and are
sampled from known-ok threaded and un-threaded bleadperl (5.9.1) builds.
They're both required, and the correct one is selected for the platform
being tested, and saved into the synthesized property B<wanted>.
d78 12
a89 1
=head2 bcopts => $bcopts || [ @@bcopts ]
d91 5
a95 2
When getRendering() runs, it passes bcopts into B::Concise::compile().
The bcopts arg can be a single string, or an array of strings.
d97 3
a99 1
=head2 errs => $err_str_regex || [ @@err_str_regexs ] 
d101 1
a101 3
getRendering() processes the code or prog arg under warnings, and both
parsing and optree-traversal errors are collected.  These are
validated against the one or more errors you specify.
d103 5
a107 1
=head1 testcase modifier properties
d109 2
a110 1
These properties are set as %tc parameters to change test behavior.
d112 1
a112 1
=head2 skip => 'reason'
d114 3
a116 1
invokes skip('reason'), causing test to skip.
d118 2
a119 1
=head2 todo => 'reason'
d121 1
a121 1
invokes todo('reason')
d123 3
a125 1
=head2 fail => 1
d127 3
a129 2
For code arguments, this option causes getRendering to redirect the
rendering operation to STDERR, which causes the regex match to fail.
d131 3
a133 1
=head2 retry => 1
d135 1
a135 2
If retry is set, and a test fails, it is run a second time, possibly
with regex debug.
d137 1
a137 1
=head2 debug => 1
d139 1
a139 2
If a failure is retried, this turns on eval "use re 'debug'", thus
turning on regex debug.  It's quite verbose, and not hugely helpful.
d141 2
a142 36
=head2 noanchors => 1

If set, this relaxes the regex check, which is normally pretty strict.
It's used primarily to validate checkOptree via tests in optree_check.


=head1 Synthesized object properties

These properties are added into the test object during execution.

=head2 wanted

This stores the chosen expect expect_nt string.  The OptreeCheck
object may in the future delete the raw strings once wanted is set,
thus saving space.

=head2 cross => 1

This tag is added if testmode=cross is passed in as argument.
It causes test-harness to purposely use the wrong string.


=head2 checkErrs

checkErrs() is a getRendering helper that verifies that expected errs
against those found when rendering the code on the platform.  It is
run after rendering, and before mkCheckRex.

Errors can be reported 3 different ways; diag, fail, print.

  diag - uses test.pl _diag()
  fail - causes double-testing
  print-.no # in front of the output (may mess up test harnesses)

The 3 ways are selectable at runtimve via cmdline-arg:
report={diag,fail,print}.

=head1 mkCheckRex ($tc)

It selects the correct golden-sample from the test-case object, and
converts it into a Regexp which should match against the original
golden-sample (used in selftest, see below), and on the renderings
obtained by applying the code on the perl being tested.

The selection is driven by platform mostly, but also by test-mode,
which rather complicates the code.  This is worsened by the potential
need to make platform specific conversions on the reftext.

The selected golden-sample is massaged to eliminate various match
irrelevancies.  This is done so that the tests dont fail just because
you added a line to the top of the test file.  (Recall that the
renderings contain the program's line numbers).  Similar cleanups are
done on "strings", hex-constants, etc.

The need to massage is reflected in the 2 golden-sample approach of
the test-cases; we want the match to be as rigorous as possible, and
thats easier to achieve when matching against 1 input than 2.

=head1 Global modes

Unusually, this module also processes @@ARGV for command-line arguments
which set global modes.  These 'options' change the way the tests run,
essentially reusing the tests for different purposes.



Additionally, there's an experimental control-arg interface (i.e.
subject to change) which allows the user to set global modes.

=head1 Testing Method

At 1st, optreeCheck used one reference-text, but the differences
between Threaded and Non-threaded renderings meant that a single
reference (sampled from say, threaded) would be tricky and iterative
to convert for testing on a non-threaded build.  Worse, this conflicts
with making tests both strict and precise.

We now use 2 reference texts, the right one is used based upon the
build's threaded-ness.  This has several benefits:

 1. native reference data allows closer/easier matching by regex.
 2. samples can be eyeballed to grok T-nT differences.
 3. data can help to validate mkCheckRex() operation.
 4. can develop regexes which accommodate T-nT differences.
 5. can test with both native and cross-converted regexes.

Cross-testing (expect_nt on threaded, expect on non-threaded) exposes
differences in B::Concise output, so mkCheckRex has code to do some
cross-test manipulations.  This area needs more work.

=head1 Test Modes

One consequence of a single-function API is difficulty controlling
test-mode.  I've chosen for now to use a package hash, %gOpts, to store
test-state.  These properties alter checkOptree() function, either
short-circuiting to selftest, or running a loop that runs the testcase
2^N times, varying conditions each time.  (current N is 2 only).

So Test-mode is controlled with cmdline args, also called options below.
Run with 'help' to see the test-state, and how to change it.

=head2  selftest

This argument invokes runSelftest(), which tests a regex against the
reference renderings that they're made from.  Failure of a regex match
its 'mold' is a strong indicator that mkCheckRex is buggy.

That said, selftest mode currently runs a cross-test too, they're not
completely orthogonal yet.  See below.

=head2 testmode=cross

Cross-testing is purposely creating a T-NT mismatch, looking at the
fallout, which helps to understand the T-NT differences.

The tweaking appears contrary to the 2-refs philosophy, but the tweaks
will be made in conversion-specific code, which (will) handles T->NT
and NT->T separately.  The tweaking is incomplete.

A reasonable 1st step is to add tags to indicate when TonNT or NTonT
is known to fail.  This needs an option to force failure, so the
test.pl reporting mechanics show results to aid the user.

=head2 testmode=native

This is normal mode.  Other valid values are: native, cross, both.

=head2 checkOptree Notes

Accepts test code, renders its optree using B::Concise, and matches
that rendering against a regex built from one of 2 reference
renderings %tc data.

The regex is built by mkCheckRex(\%tc), which scrubs %tc data to
remove match-irrelevancies, such as (args) and [args].  For example,
it strips leading '# ', making it easy to cut-paste new tests into
your test-file, run it, and cut-paste actual results into place.  You
then retest and reedit until all 'errors' are gone.  (now make sure you
haven't 'enshrined' a bug).

name: The test name.  May be augmented by a label, which is built from
important params, and which helps keep names in sync with whats being
tested.
