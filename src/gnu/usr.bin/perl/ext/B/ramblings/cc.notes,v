@At entry to each basic block, the following can be assumed (and hence
must be forced where necessary at the end of each basic block):

The shadow stack @@stack is empty.
For each lexical object in @@pad, VALID_IV holds for each T_INT,
VALID_DOUBLE holds for each T_DOUBLE and VALID_SV holds otherwise.
The C shadow variable sp holds the stack pointer (not necessarily stack_sp).

write_back_stack
    Writes the contents of the shadow stack @@stack back to the real stack.
    A write-back of each object in the stack is forced so that its
    backing SV contains the right value and that SV is then pushed onto the
    real stack. On return, @@stack is empty.

write_back_lexicals
    Forces a write-back (i.e. achieves VALID_SV), where necessary, for each
    lexical object in @@pad. Objects with the TEMPORARY flag are skipped. If
    write_back_lexicals is called with an (optional) argument, then it is
    taken to be a bitmask of more flags: any lexical object with one of those
    flags set is also skipped and not written back to its SV.

invalidate_lexicals($avoid)
    The VALID_INT and VALID_DOUBLE flags are turned off for each lexical
    object in @@pad whose flags field doesn't overlap with $avoid.

reload_lexicals
    For each necessary lexical object in @@pad, makes sure that VALID_IV
    holds for objects of type T_INT, VALID_DOUBLE holds for objects for
    type T_DOUBLE, and VALID_SV holds for other objects. An object is
    considered for reloading if its flags field does not overlap with the
    (optional) argument passed to reload_lexicals.
