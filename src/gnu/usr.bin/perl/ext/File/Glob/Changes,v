@Revision history for Perl extension File::Glob

0.00  Tue Dec 17 10:51:33 1996
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.16

0.90  Tue Dec 17 13:58:32 MST 1996
	- implemented first pass access to glob(3),
	  but it's clumsy and it looks like it leaks
	  memory.

0.91  Thu Sep  4 08:43:55 CDT 1997
	- included CORE/config.h portability macros
	- s/glob/bsd_glob/ to avoid calling and including the
	  system's glob stuff
	- added GLOB_DEBUG for (surprise!) glob debugging
	- tainted all filenames returned from &Glob::BSD::glob

0.92  Tue Sep 30 08:31:57 CDT 1997
	- only use lstat if HAS_LSTAT is defined
	- renamed the glob flags to GLOB_*
	- added GLOB_CSH convenience macro for csh(1) globbing
	These changes thanks to Hans Mulder <hansm@@icgned.nl>
	- fixed an incompatibility with csh(1) globbing where a
	  pattern like {A*,b,c} wouldn't expand properly
	- various compatibility changes
	- fixed and added tests

0.93  Wed Jul  1 10:39:47 CDT 1998
	- renamed module to File::BSDGlob
	- enabled 'globally' import directive to override the core
	  glob
	- added Sarathy's tests for File::DosGlob
0.99  Tue Oct 12 06:42:02 PDT 1999
	- renamed module to File::Glob for incorporation into the
	  Perl source distribution
	- ansified prototypes
	- s/struct stat/Stat_t/
	- split on spaces to make <*.c *.h> work (for compatibility)
0.991 Tue Oct 26 09:48:00 BST 1999
	- Add case-insensitive matching (GLOB_NOCASE)
	- Make glob_csh case insensitive by default on Win32, VMS,
	  OS/2, DOS, RISC OS, and Mac OS
	- Add support for :case and :nocase tags
	- Hack to make patterns like C:* work on DOSISH systems
	- Add support for either \ or / as separators on DOSISH systems
	- Limit effect of \ as a quoting operator on DOSISH systems to
	  when it precedes one of []{}-~\ (to minimise backslashitis).
0.992 Tue Mar 20 09:25:48 2001
	- Add alphabetic sorting for csh compatibility (GLOB_ALPHASORT)
