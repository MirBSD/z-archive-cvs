===================================

Unicode::Normalize - Unicode Normalization Forms

SYNOPSIS

  use Unicode::Normalize;

  $NFD_string  = NFD($string);  # Normalization Form D
  $NFC_string  = NFC($string);  # Normalization Form C
  $NFKD_string = NFKD($string); # Normalization Form KD
  $NFKC_string = NFKC($string); # Normalization Form KC

  or

  use Unicode::Normalize 'normalize';

  $NFD_string  = normalize('D',  $string);  # Normalization Form D
  $NFC_string  = normalize('C',  $string);  # Normalization Form C
  $NFKD_string = normalize('KD', $string);  # Normalization Form KD
  $NFKC_string = normalize('KC', $string);  # Normalization Form KC


INSTALLATION

Perl 5.6.1 or later.
(Perl 5.8.0 or later is recommended.)

To install this module (XSUB: needs a C compiler), type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install pure Perl (i.e. no-XSUB),
type the following (!! "disableXS" must run before "Makefile.PL" !!):

   perl disableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

After building no-XSUB, if you decide to install XSUB,
type the following (!! "enableXS" must run before "Makefile.PL" !!):

   make clean
   perl enableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires other modules and libraries following:

Carp
Exporter
File::Copy
File::Spec

unicore/CombiningClass.pl         (or unicode/CombiningClass.pl)
unicore/Decomposition.pl          (or unicode/Decomposition.pl)
unicore/CompositionExclusions.txt (or unicode/CompExcl.txt)

CAVEAT

(1) In the perl-current, unicore/CompExcl.txt
  is renamed unicore/CompositionExclusions.txt.

(2) After these unicore/*.* files are updated.

  In the case of an XS edition:
    You must rebuild the module,
    as the data will be compiled on building.

  In the case of a pure Perl edition:
    Rebuilding is not necessary,
    as the data will be read on requirement.

(3) Pure Perl edition, Normalize.pmN, may work without any other file
    in this distribution (it must be renamed Normalize.pm, though)
