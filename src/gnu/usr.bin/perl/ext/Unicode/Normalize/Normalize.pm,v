=head1 NAME

Unicode::Normalize - Unicode Normalization Forms

=head1 SYNOPSIS

(1) using function names exported by default:

  use Unicode::Normalize;

  $NFD_string  = NFD($string);  # Normalization Form D
  $NFC_string  = NFC($string);  # Normalization Form C
  $NFKD_string = NFKD($string); # Normalization Form KD
  $NFKC_string = NFKC($string); # Normalization Form KC

(2) using function names exported on request:

  use Unicode::Normalize 'normalize';

  $NFD_string  = normalize('D',  $string);  # Normalization Form D
  $NFC_string  = normalize('C',  $string);  # Normalization Form C
  $NFKD_string = normalize('KD', $string);  # Normalization Form KD
  $NFKC_string = normalize('KC', $string);  # Normalization Form KC

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parameters:

C<$string> is used as a string under character semantics
(see F<perlunicode>).

C<$codepoint> should be an unsigned integer
representing a Unicode code point.

Note: Between XS edition and pure Perl edition,
interpretation of C<$codepoint> as a decimal number has incompatibility.
XS converts C<$codepoint> to an unsigned integer, but pure Perl does not.
Do not use a floating point nor a negative sign in C<$codepoint>.

=head2 Normalization Forms

=over 4

=item C<$NFD_string = NFD($string)>

returns the Normalization Form D (formed by canonical decomposition).

=item C<$NFC_string = NFC($string)>

returns the Normalization Form C (formed by canonical decomposition
followed by canonical composition).

=item C<$NFKD_string = NFKD($string)>

returns the Normalization Form KD (formed by compatibility decomposition).

=item C<$NFKC_string = NFKC($string)>

returns the Normalization Form KC (formed by compatibility decomposition
followed by B<canonical> composition).

=item C<$FCD_string = FCD($string)>

If the given string is in FCD ("Fast C or D" form; cf. UTN #5),
returns it without modification; otherwise returns an FCD string.

Note: FCD is not always unique, then plural forms may be equivalent
each other. C<FCD()> will return one of these equivalent forms.

=item C<$FCC_string = FCC($string)>

returns the FCC form ("Fast C Contiguous"; cf. UTN #5).

Note: FCC is unique, as well as four normalization forms (NF*).

=item C<$normalized_string = normalize($form_name, $string)>

As C<$form_name>, one of the following names must be given.

  'C'  or 'NFC'  for Normalization Form C  (UAX #15)
  'D'  or 'NFD'  for Normalization Form D  (UAX #15)
  'KC' or 'NFKC' for Normalization Form KC (UAX #15)
  'KD' or 'NFKD' for Normalization Form KD (UAX #15)

  'FCD'          for "Fast C or D" Form  (UTN #5)
  'FCC'          for "Fast C Contiguous" (UTN #5)

=head2 Decomposition and Composition

=over 4

=item C<$decomposed_string = decompose($string)>

=item C<$decomposed_string = decompose($string, $useCompatMapping)>

Decomposes the specified string and returns the result.

If the second parameter (a boolean) is omitted or false, decomposes it
using the Canonical Decomposition Mapping.
If true, decomposes it using the Compatibility Decomposition Mapping.

The string returned is not always in NFD/NFKD.
Reordering may be required.

    $NFD_string  = reorder(decompose($string));       # eq. to NFD()
    $NFKD_string = reorder(decompose($string, TRUE)); # eq. to NFKD()

=item C<$reordered_string  = reorder($string)>

Reorders the combining characters and the like in the canonical ordering
and returns the result.

E.g., when you have a list of NFD/NFKD strings,
you can get the concatenated NFD/NFKD string from them, saying

    $concat_NFD  = reorder(join '', @@NFD_strings);
    $concat_NFKD = reorder(join '', @@NFKD_strings);

=item C<$composed_string   = compose($string)>

Returns the string where composable pairs are composed.

E.g., when you have a NFD/NFKD string,
you can get its NFC/NFKC string, saying

    $NFC_string  = compose($NFD_string);
    $NFKC_string = compose($NFKD_string);

=back

=head2 Quick Check

(see Annex 8, UAX #15; and F<DerivedNormalizationProps.txt>)

The following functions check whether the string is in that normalization form.

The result returned will be:

    YES     The string is in that normalization form.
    NO      The string is not in that normalization form.
    MAYBE   Dubious. Maybe yes, maybe no.

=over 4

=item C<$result = checkNFD($string)>

returns C<YES> (C<1>) or C<NO> (C<empty string>).

=item C<$result = checkNFC($string)>

returns C<YES> (C<1>), C<NO> (C<empty string>), or C<MAYBE> (C<undef>).

=item C<$result = checkNFKD($string)>

returns C<YES> (C<1>) or C<NO> (C<empty string>).

=item C<$result = checkNFKC($string)>

returns C<YES> (C<1>), C<NO> (C<empty string>), or C<MAYBE> (C<undef>).

=item C<$result = checkFCD($string)>

returns C<YES> (C<1>) or C<NO> (C<empty string>).

=item C<$result = checkFCC($string)>

returns C<YES> (C<1>), C<NO> (C<empty string>), or C<MAYBE> (C<undef>).

If a string is not in FCD, it must not be in FCC.
So C<checkFCC($not_FCD_string)> should return C<NO>.

=item C<$result = check($form_name, $string)>

returns C<YES> (C<1>), C<NO> (C<empty string>), or C<MAYBE> (C<undef>).

C<$form_name> is alike to that for C<normalize()>.

=back

B<Note>

In the cases of NFD, NFKD, and FCD, the answer must be
either C<YES> or C<NO>. The answer C<MAYBE> may be returned
in the cases of NFC, NFKC, and FCC.

A C<MAYBE> string should contain at least one combining character
or the like. For example, C<COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT> has
the MAYBE_NFC/MAYBE_NFKC property.

Both C<checkNFC("A\N{COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT}")>
and C<checkNFC("B\N{COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT}")> will return C<MAYBE>.
C<"A\N{COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT}"> is not in NFC
(its NFC is C<"\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE}">),
while C<"B\N{COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT}"> is in NFC.

If you want to check exactly, compare the string with its NFC/NFKC/FCC;
i.e.,

    $string eq NFC($string)    # thorough than checkNFC($string)
    $string eq NFKC($string)   # thorough than checkNFKC($string)
    $string eq FCC($string)    # thorough than checkFCC($string)

=head2 Character Data

These functions are interface of character data used internally.
If you want only to get Unicode normalization forms, you don't need
call them yourself.

=over 4

=item C<$canonical_decomposed = getCanon($codepoint)>

If the character of the specified codepoint is canonically
decomposable (including Hangul Syllables),
returns the B<completely decomposed> string canonically equivalent to it.

If it is not decomposable, returns C<undef>.

=item C<$compatibility_decomposed = getCompat($codepoint)>

If the character of the specified codepoint is compatibility
decomposable (including Hangul Syllables),
returns the B<completely decomposed> string compatibility equivalent to it.

If it is not decomposable, returns C<undef>.

=item C<$codepoint_composite = getComposite($codepoint_here, $codepoint_next)>

If two characters here and next (as codepoints) are composable
(including Hangul Jamo/Syllables and Composition Exclusions),
returns the codepoint of the composite.

If they are not composable, returns C<undef>.

=item C<$combining_class = getCombinClass($codepoint)>

Returns the combining class of the character as an integer.

=item C<$is_exclusion = isExclusion($codepoint)>

Returns a boolean whether the character of the specified codepoint
is a composition exclusion.

=item C<$is_singleton = isSingleton($codepoint)>

Returns a boolean whether the character of the specified codepoint is
a singleton.

=item C<$is_non_starter_decomposition = isNonStDecomp($codepoint)>

Returns a boolean whether the canonical decomposition
of the character of the specified codepoint
is a Non-Starter Decomposition.

=item C<$may_be_composed_with_prev_char = isComp2nd($codepoint)>

Returns a boolean whether the character of the specified codepoint
may be composed with the previous one in a certain composition
(including Hangul Compositions, but excluding
Composition Exclusions and Non-Starter Decompositions).

=back

=head2 EXPORT

=item Perl's version vs. Unicode version

Since this module refers to perl core's Unicode database in the directory
F</lib/unicore> (or formerly F</lib/unicode>), the Unicode version of
normalization implemented by this module depends on your perl's version.

    perl's version         implemented Unicode version
       5.6.1                  3.0.1
       5.7.2                  3.1.0
       5.7.3                  3.1.1 (same normalized form as that of 3.1.0)
       5.8.0                  3.2.0
     5.8.1-5.8.3              4.0.0
     5.8.4-5.8.6 (latest)     4.0.1 (same normalized form as that of 4.0.0)

=item Correction of decomposition mapping

In older Unicode versions, a small number of characters (all of which are
CJK compatibility ideographs as far as they have been found) may have
an erroneous decomposition mapping (see F<NormalizationCorrections.txt>).
Anyhow, this module will neither refer to F<NormalizationCorrections.txt>
nor provide any specific version of normalization. Therefore this module
running on an older perl with an older Unicode database may use
the erroneous decomposition mapping blindly conforming to the Unicode database.

=item Revised definition of canonical composition

In Unicode 4.1.0, the definition D2 of canonical composition (which
affects NFC and NFKC) has been changed (see Public Review Issue #29
and recent UAX #15). This module has used the newer definition
since the version 0.07 (Oct 31, 2001).
This module does not support normalization according to the older
definition, even if the Unicode version implemented by perl is
lower than 4.1.0.
