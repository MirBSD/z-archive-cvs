@This distribution is a replacement for the builtin distribution.

This package contains a selection of subroutines that people have
expressed would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not
really be high enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size so
small such that being individual extensions would be wasteful.

After unpacking the distribution, to install this module type
 
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

This distribution provides

  min
  max
  minstr
  maxstr
  sum
  reduce
  reftype
  blessed
  weaken   (5.005_57 and later only)
  isweak   (5.005_57 and later only)
  dualvar
  shuffle

KNOWN BUGS

There is a bug in perl5.6.0 with UV's that are >= 1<<31. This will
show up as tests 8 and 9 of dualvar.t failing
