@0.3: Some functions return SV * now.
0.4: Hashes dumped recursively.
     Additional fields for CV added.
0.5: Prototypes for functions supported. 
     Strings are consostently in quotes now.
     Name changed to Devel::Peek (former ExtUtils::Peek).
0.7:
	New function mstat added.
	Docs added (thanks to Dean Roehrich).

0.8:
	Exports Dump and mstat.
	Docs list more details.
	Arrays print addresses of SV.
	CV: STASH renamed to COMP_STASH. The package of GV is printed now.
	Updated for newer overloading implementation (but will not report
		packages with overloading).
0.81:
	Implements and exports DeadCode().
	Buglet in the definition of mstat for malloc-less perl corrected.
0.82:
	New style PADless CV allowed.
0.83:
	DumpArray added.
	Compatible with PerlIO.
	When calculating junk inside subs, divide by refcount.
0.84:
	Indented output.
0.85:
	By Gisle Aas: format SvPVX, print magic (but not unrefcounted mg_obj);
	A lot of new fields stolen from sv_dump();
0.86:
	By Gisle Aas:
	   - Updated the documentation.
	   - Move string printer to it's own function: fprintpv()
	   - Use it to print PVs, HV keys, MG_PTR
	   - Don't print IV for hashes as KEY is the same field
	   - Tag GvSTASH as "GvSTASH" in order to not confuse it with
	     the other STASH field, e.g.  Dump(bless \*foo, "bar")
0.87:
	Extra indentation of SvRV.
	AMAGIC removed.
	Head of OOK data printed too.
0.88:
	PADLIST and OUTSIDE of CVs itemized.
	Prints the value of the hash of HV keys.
	Changes by Gisle: do not print both if AvARRAY == AvALLOC;
			  print hash fill statistics.
0.89:
	Changes by Gisle: optree dump.
0.90:
	DumpWithOP, DumpProg exported.
	Better indent for AV, HV elts.
	Address of SV printed.
	Corrected Zero code which was causing segfaults.
0.91:
	Compiles, runs test under 5.005beta2.
	Update DEBUGGING_MSTATS-less MSTATS.
0.92:
	Should compile without MYMALLOC too.
0.94:
	Had problems with HEf_SVKEY magic.
0.95:
	Added "hash quality" output to estimate Perl's hash functions.
