 * NOTES
 *   This function goes to fairly great lengths to avoid allocating memory so
 *   that it can relay out-of-memory error messages to the client.  Any error
 *   messages which fit in under 256 characters (after expanding MESSAGE with
 *   ARGS but before adding any ERRNUM text) should not require memory
 *   allocation before they are sent on to cvs_outerr().  Unfortunately,
 *   cvs_outerr() and the buffer functions it uses to send messages to the
 *   client still don't make this same sort of effort, so in local mode
 *   out-of-memory errors will probably get printed properly to stderr but if a
 *   memory outage happens on the server, the admin will need to consult the
 *   syslog to find out what went wrong.
 *
 *   I think this is largely cleaned up to the point where it does the right
 *   thing for the server, whether the normal server_active (child process)
 *   case or the error_use_protocol (parent process) case.  The one exception
 *   is that STATUS nonzero for error_use_protocol probably doesn't work yet;
 *   in that case still need to use the pending_error machinery in server.c.
 *
 *   error() does not molest errno; some code (e.g. Entries_Open) depends
 *   on being able to say something like:
 *
 *      error (0, 0, "foo");
 *      error (0, errno, "bar");
 *
 * RETURNS
 *   Sometimes.  ;)

   format string with optional args.  This is a very limited printf subset:
   %s, %d, %c, %x and %% only (without anything between the % and the s,
   d, &c).  Callers who want something fancier can use sprintf.

   If ERRNUM is nonzero, print its corresponding system error message.
   Exit with status EXIT_FAILURE if STATUS is nonzero.  If MESSAGE is "",
   no need to print a message.

   I think this is largely cleaned up to the point where it does the right
   thing for the server, whether the normal server_active (child process)
   case or the error_use_protocol (parent process) case.  The one exception
   is that STATUS nonzero for error_use_protocol probably doesn't work yet;
   in that case still need to use the pending_error machinery in server.c.

   error() does not molest errno; some code (e.g. Entries_Open) depends
   on being able to say something like:
      error (0, 0, "foo");
      error (0, errno, "bar");
