/* There are various things to improve about this implementation:

   1.  Using run_popen to run "cvs update" could be replaced by a
   fairly simple start_recursion/classify_file loop--a win for
   portability, performance, and cleanliness.  In particular, there is
   no particularly good way to find the right "cvs".

   2.  The fact that "cvs update" contacts the server slows things down;
   it undermines the case for using "cvs release" rather than "rm -rf".
   However, for correctly printing "? foo" and correctly handling
   CVSROOTADM_IGNORE, we currently need to contact the server.  (One
   idea for how to fix this is to stash a copy of CVSROOTADM_IGNORE in
   the working directories; see comment at base_* in entries.c for a
   few thoughts on that).

   3.  Would be nice to take processing things on the client side one step
   further, and making it like edit/unedit in terms of working well if
   disconnected from the network, and then sending a delayed
   notification.

   4.  Having separate network turnarounds for the "Notify" request
   which we do as part of unedit, and for the "release" itself, is slow
   and unnecessary.  */
