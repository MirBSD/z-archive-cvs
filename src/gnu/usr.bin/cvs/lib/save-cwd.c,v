/* Record the location of the current working directory in CWD so that
   the program may change to other directories and later use restore_cwd
   to return to the recorded location.  This function may allocate
   space using malloc (via xgetcwd) or leave a file descriptor open;
   use free_cwd to perform the necessary free or close.  Upon failure,
   no memory is allocated, any locally opened file descriptors are
   closed;  return non-zero -- in that case, free_cwd need not be
   called, but doing so is ok.  Otherwise, return zero.

   The `raison d'etre' for this interface is that some systems lack
   support for fchdir, and getcwd is not robust or as efficient.
   So, we prefer to use the open/fchdir approach, but fall back on
   getcwd if necessary.  Some systems lack fchdir altogether: OS/2,
   Cygwin (as of March 2003), SCO Xenix.  At least SunOS 4 and Irix 5.3
   provide the function, yet it doesn't work for partitions on which
