/* Remove trailing slashes from PATH.
   Return true if a trailing slash was removed.
   This is useful when using filename completion from a shell that
   adds a "/" after directory names (such as tcsh and bash), because
   the Unix rename and rmdir system calls return an "Invalid argument" error
   when given a path that ends in "/" (except for the root directory).  */
