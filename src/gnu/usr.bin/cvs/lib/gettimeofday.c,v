@/* Work around the bug in some systems whereby gettimeofday clobbers the
   static buffer that localtime uses for it's return value.  The gettimeofday
   function from Mac OS X 10.0.4, i.e. Darwin 1.3.7 has this problem.
   The tzset replacement is necessary for at least Solaris 2.5, 2.5.1, and 2.6.
