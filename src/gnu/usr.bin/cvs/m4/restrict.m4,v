# This macro can be removed once we can rely on Autoconf 2.57a or later,
# since we can then use its AC_C_RESTRICT.

# gl_C_RESTRICT
# --------------
# Determine whether the C/C++ compiler supports the "restrict" keyword
# introduced in ANSI C99, or an equivalent.  Do nothing if the compiler
# accepts it.  Otherwise, if the compiler supports an equivalent,
# define "restrict" to be that.  Here are some variants:
# - GCC supports both __restrict and __restrict__
# - older DEC Alpha C compilers support only __restrict
# - _Restrict is the only spelling accepted by Sun WorkShop 6 update 2 C
# Otherwise, define "restrict" to be empty.

[AC_CACHE_CHECK([for C/C++ restrict keyword], gl_cv_c_restrict,
  [gl_cv_c_restrict=no
   # Try the official restrict keyword, then gcc's __restrict, and
   # the less common variants.
