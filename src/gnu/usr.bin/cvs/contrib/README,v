@This "contrib" directory is a place holder for code/scripts sent to me
by contributors around the world.  This README file will be kept
up-to-date from release to release.  BUT, we must point out that these
contributions are really, REALLY UNSUPPORTED.  In fact, we probably
don't even know what some of them really do.  We certainly do not
guarantee to have tried them, or ported them to work with this CVS
distribution.  If you have questions, your best bet is to contact the
original author, but you should not necessarily expect a reply, since
the author may not be available at the address given.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK -- and all that stuff.

"Unsupported" also means that no one has volunteered to accept and check
in changes to this directory.  So submissions for new scripts to add
here are unlikely to be accepted.  Suggested changes to the existing
scripts here conceivably might, but that isn't clear either, unless of
course they come from the original author of the script.

If you have some software that works with CVS that you wish to offer it
is suggested that you make it available by FTP or HTTP and then announce
it on the info-cvs mailing list.

An attempt at a table of Contents for this directory:

	README		This file.

	check_cvs	A perl script to check an entire repository for
			corruption.
			Contributed by Donald Sharp <sharpd@@cisco.com>.

 	clmerge		A perl script to handle merge conflicts in GNU
			style ChangeLog files .
			Contributed by Tom Tromey <tromey@@busco.lanl.gov>.

	cln_hist	A perl script to compress your
			$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history file, as it can grow quite
			large after extended use.
			Contributed by David G. Grubbs <dgg@@ksr.com>

	commit_prep	A perl script, to be combined with log_accum.pl, to
	log_accum	provide for a way to combine the individual log
			messages of a multi-directory "commit" into a
			single log message, and mail the result somewhere.
			Can also do other checks for $Id and that you are
			committing the correct revision of the file.
			Read the comments carefully.
			Contributed by David Hampton <hampton@@cisco.com>.

	cvs2vendor	A shell script to move changes from a repository
			that was started without a vendor branch to one
			that has a vendor branch.
			Contributed by Greg A. Woods <woods@@planix.com>.

	cvs_acls	A perl script that implements Access Control Lists
	cvs_acls.html	by using the "commitinfo" hook provided with the
			"cvs commit" command.
			Contributed by David G. Grubbs <dgg@@ksr.com>.
			Enhanced by Peter Connolly <Peter.Connolly@@cnet.com>.

	cvscheck	Identifies files added, changed, or removed in a
	cvscheck.man	checked out CVS tree; also notices unknown files.
			Contributed by Lowell Skoog <fluke!lowell@@uunet.uu.net>

	cvshelp.man	An introductory manual page written by Lowell Skoog
			<fluke!lowell@@uunet.uu.net>.  It is most likely
			out-of-date relative to CVS 1.3, but still may be
			useful.

	debug_check_log	A shell script to help analyze sanity check failures.
			Contributed by Derek R. Price
			<derek.price@@openavenue.com>

	descend		A shell script that can be used to recursively
	descend.man	descend through a directory.  In CVS 1.2, this was
			very useful, since many of the commands were not
			recursive.  In CVS 1.3 (and later), however, most of
			the commands are recursive.  However, this may still
			come in handy.
			Contributed by Lowell Skoog <fluke!lowell@@uunet.uu.net>

	dirfns		A shar file which contains some code that might
			help your system support opendir/readdir/closedir,
			if it does not already.
			Copied from the C-News distribution.

	intro.doc	A user's view of what you need to know to get
			started with CVS.
			Contributed by <Steven.Pemberton@@cwi.nl>.

	log		A perl script suitable for including in your
			$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/loginfo file for logging commit
			changes.  Includes the RCS revision of the change
			as part of the log.
			Contributed by Kevin Samborn <samborn@@sunrise.com>.

	log_accum	See commit_prep.

	mfpipe		Another perl script for logging.  Allows you to
			pipe the log message to a file and/or send mail
			to some alias.
			Contributed by John Clyne <clyne@@niwot.scd.ucar.edu>.

	pvcs2rcs	A perl script to convert a PVCS tree to an RCS tree.

	rcs-to-cvs	Script to import sources that may have been under
			RCS control already.
			Contributed by Per Cederqvist <ceder@@lysator.liu.se>.

	rcs2log		A shell script to create a ChangeLog-format file
			given only a set of RCS files.
			Contributed by Paul Eggert <eggert@@twinsun.com>.

	rcs2sccs	A shell script to convert simple RCS files into
			SCCS files, originally gleaned off the network
			somewhere (originally by "kenc") and modified by
			Jerry Jelinek <jerry@@rmtc.Central.Sun.COM> and
			Brian Berliner <berliner@@sun.com> to increase
			robustness and add support for one-level of branches.

	rcslock		A perl script that can be added to your commitinfo
			file that tries to determine if your RCS file is
			currently locked by someone else, as might be the
			case for a binary file.
			Contributed by John Rouillard <rouilj@@cs.umb.edu>.

	sccs2rcs	A C-shell script that can convert (some) SCCS files
			into RCS files, retaining the info contained in the
			SCCS file (like dates, author, and log message).
			Contributed by Ken Cox <kenstir@@viewlogic.com>.
