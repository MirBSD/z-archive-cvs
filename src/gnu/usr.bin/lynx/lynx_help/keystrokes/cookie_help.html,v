<h1>+++ Cookie Jar Page Help +++</h1>

The Cookie Jar Page displays all of the unexpired cookies you have
accumulated in the hypothetical <em>Cookie Jar</em>.  The cookies are
obtained via <em>Set-Cookie</em> MIME headers in replies from http servers,
and are used for <A HREF="../Lynx_users_guide.html#Cookies">State Management</A>
across successive requests to the servers.

<p>The cookies are listed by <em>domain</em> (server's Fully Qualified
Domain Name, or site-identifying portion of the FQDN), and in order
of decreasing specificity (number of slash-separated symbolic elements
in the <em>path</em> attribute of the cookie).  When Lynx sends requests
to an http server whose address tail-matches a <em>domain</em> in the
<em>Cookie Jar</em>, all its cookies with a <em>path</em> which
head-matches the path in the URL for that request are included as a
<em>Cookie</em> MIME header.  The 'allow' setting for accepting cookies
from each domain (always, never, or via prompt) also is indicated in the
listing.

<p>The listing also shows the <em>port</em> (normally 80) of the URL
for the request which caused the cookie to be sent, and whether the
<em>secure</em> flag is set for the cookie, in which case it will be
sent only via secure connections (presently, only SSL).  The
<em>Maximum Gobble Date</em>, i.e., when the cookie is intended to
expire, also is indicated.  Also, a server may change the expiration date,
or cause the cookie to be deleted, in its replies to subsequent requests
from Lynx.  If the server included any explanatory comments in its
<em>Set-Cookie</em> MIME headers, those also are displayed in the listing.

<p>The <em>domain</em>=value pairs, and each cookie's name=value, are
links in the listing.  Activating a <em>domain</em>=value link will
invoke a prompt asking whether all cookies in that <em>domain</em>
should be <em>Gobbled</em> (deleted from the <em>Cookie Jar</em>),
and/or whether the <em>domain</em> entry should be <em>Gobbled</em>
if all of its cookies have been <em>Gobbled</em>, or whether to change
the 'allow' setting for that <em>domain</em>.  Activating a cookie's
name=value link will cause that particular cookie to be <em>Gobbled</em>.
You will be prompted for confirmations of deletions, to avoid any
accidental <em>Gobbling</em>.
