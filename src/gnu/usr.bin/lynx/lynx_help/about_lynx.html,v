  <h1><em>About Lynx</em></h1>

  <p>Lynx is a fully-featured <em>World Wide Web</em>
  (<em>WWW</em>) browser for users on Unix, VMS, and other
  platforms running cursor-addressable, character-cell terminals or
  emulators. That includes vt100 terminals, other character-cell
  displays, and vt100 emulators such as Kermit or Procomm running
  on PCs or Macs.</p>
