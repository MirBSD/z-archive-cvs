@first attempt to merge binutils and gdb of today (minus generated files)
XXX elf.sc yields equivalent results for MirOS; double-check against
XXX other platforms. this merger took as much time as ALL the other files!

         of #line directives, so if you debug a YACC parser you'll get
         a macro table which only mentions the .c files generated by
         YACC, but symtabs that mention the .y files consumed by YACC.

         In the long run, we should extend the Dwarf macro info
         representation to handle #line directives, and get GCC to
         emit it.
