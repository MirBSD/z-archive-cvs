@# Host: Intel 386 running SVR4

# we don't want nm-i386v4.h since that defines LOSING_POLL which isn't
# appropriate for i386v42mp
NAT_FILE= nm-i386v42mp.h

# NATDEPFILES must remain entirely on one line.  When building a cross
# debugger, configure will cause this line to be commented out in the
# Makefile.  Many non-GNU versions of make don't permit the use of a
# continuation character (backslash) to extend a commented line.  As a
# consequence, make considers subsequent tab-indented lines to be
# some sort of error.
