@/* ***DEPRECATED***  The gdblib files must not be calling/using things in any
   of the possible command languages.  If necessary, a hook (that may be
   present or not) must be used and set to the appropriate routine by any
   command language that cares about it.  If you are having to include this
   file you are possibly doing things the old way.  This file will disapear.
