@/* opintl.h - opcodes specific header for gettext code.

/* Note the use of dgetext() and PACKAGE here, rather than gettext().
   
   This is because the code in this directory is used to build a library which
   will be linked with code in other directories to form programs.  We want to
   maintain a seperate translation file for this directory however, rather
   than being forced to merge it with that of any program linked to
   libopcodes.  This is a library, so it cannot depend on the catalog
   currently loaded.

   In order to do this, we have to make sure that when we extract messages we
   use the OPCODES domain rather than the domain of the program that included
   the opcodes library, (eg OBJDUMP).  Hence we use dgettext (PACKAGE, String)
   and define PACKAGE to be 'opcodes'.  (See the code in configure).  */
