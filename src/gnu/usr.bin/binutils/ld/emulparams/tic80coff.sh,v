# uses scripttempl/tic80coff.sc
#
SCRIPT_NAME=tic80coff

# The name of the emultempl script to use.  If set to "template" then
# genscripts.sh will use the script emultempl/template.em.  If not set,

# an OUTPUT_FORMAT expression in the linker script.

# its value before running the scripttempl script for the -n and -N
# options.
#
# NONPAGED_TEXT_START_ADDR=

# The genscripts.sh script uses this to set the default value of 
# DATA_ALIGNMENT when running the scripttempl script.

# to define it.
