/* Define groups of basic relocations.  FIXME:  These should
   be the only basic relocations created by GAS.  The rest
   should be internal to the BFD backend.

   The idea is both SOM and ELF define these basic relocation
   types so they map into a SOM or ELF specific relocation
   as appropriate.  This allows GAS to share much more code
   between the two target object formats.  */
