@@deftypefn Supplemental int unlink_if_ordinary (const char*)

Unlinks the named file, unless it is special (e.g. a device file).
Returns 0 when the file was unlinked, a negative value (and errno set) when
there was an error deleting the file, and a positive value if no attempt
was made to unlink the file because it is special.
