   unicode support in windres.  Our unicode support is very limited at
   present.

   We don't put this stuff in windres.h so that winduni.c doesn't have
   to include windres.h.  winduni.c needs to includes windows.h, and
   that would conflict with the definitions of Windows macros we
   already have in windres.h.  */
