@/* Macros for taking apart, interpreting and processing file names.

   These are here because some non-Posix (a.k.a. DOSish) systems have
   drive letter brain-damage at the beginning of an absolute file name,
   use forward- and back-slash in path names interchangeably, and
   some of them have case-insensitive file names.
