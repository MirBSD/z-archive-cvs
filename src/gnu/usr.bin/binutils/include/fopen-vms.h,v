@/* Macros for the 'type' part of an fopen, freopen or fdopen. 

	<Read|Write>[Update]<Binary file|text file>

   This version is for VMS systems, where text and binary files are
   different.
   This file is designed for inclusion by host-dependent .h files.  No
   user application should include it directly, since that would make
   the application unable to be configured for both "same" and "binary"
   variant systems.  */
