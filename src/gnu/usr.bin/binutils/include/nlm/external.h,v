/* This file is part of NLM support for BFD, and contains the portions
   that describe how NLM is represented externally by the BFD library.
   I.E. it describes the in-file representation of NLM.  It requires
   the nlm/common.h file which contains the portions that are common to
   both the internal and external representations.

   Note that an NLM header consists of three parts:

   (1)	A fixed length header that has specific fields of known length,
	at specific offsets in the file. 

   (2)  A variable length header that has specific fields in a specific
        order, but some fields may be variable length.

   (3)	A auxiliary header that has various optional fields in no specific
        order.  There is no way to identify the end of the auxiliary headers
	except by finding a header without a recognized 'stamp'.

   The exact format of the fixed length header unfortunately varies
   from one NLM target to another, due to padding.  Each target
   defines the correct external format in a separate header file.
