.Sh NAME
.Nm nohup
.Nd invoke a command immune to hangups
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nohup
.Ar utility
.Op Ar arg ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm nohup
utility invokes
.Ar command
with
its arguments
and at this time sets the signal
.Dv SIGHUP
to be ignored.
If the standard output is a terminal, the standard output is
appended to the file
.Pa nohup.out
in the current directory.
If standard error is a terminal, it is directed to the same place
as the standard output.
.Pp
The
.Nm nohup
utility shall exit with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It 126
The
.Ar utility
was found but could not be invoked.
.It 127
The
.Ar utility
could not be found or an error occurred in
.Nm nohup .
.El
.Pp
Otherwise, the exit status of
.Nm nohup
shall be that of
.Ar utility .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Ev HOME
If the output file
.Pa nohup.out
cannot be created in the current directory, the
.Nm nohup
utility uses the directory named by
.Ev HOME
to create the file.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr signal 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm nohup
command is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compatible.

.Nm
command allows the specified utility to be protected from termination
if the user should become logged out
(for example, due to a modem line or TCP/IP connection being dropped).
To do this,
.Nm
sets the
d55 1
a55 7
.Xr signal 3
.Pq Dq terminal line hangup
to be ignored,
then executes
.Ar utility
along with any arguments.

If the output file
.Pa nohup.out
cannot be created in the current directory,
.Nm
attempts to create the file in the user's home directory.
If the file
.Pa nohup.out
cannot be created,
either in the current directory or the user's home directory,
.Nm
will exit without invoking
.Ar utility ,
with an exit value as described below.
