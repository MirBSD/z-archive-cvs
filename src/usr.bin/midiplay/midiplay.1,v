.Sh NAME
.Nm midiplay
.Nd play MIDI and RMID files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm midiplay
.Op Fl lmqvx
.Op Fl d Ar devno
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl t Ar tempo
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command plays MIDI and RMID files using the sequencer device.
.Pp
RMID files are Standard MIDI Files embedded in a RIFF container and
can usually be found with the 'rmi' extension.
They contain some additional information in other chunks which are
not parsed by
.Nm
yet.
RIFF containers can contain more than one chunk of data; however, using
.Nm
on these is not supported and will behave unpredictably.
.Pp
If no file name is given it will play from standard input;
otherwise it will play the named files.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-d devnoXX"
.It Fl d Ar devno
Specifies the number of the MIDI device used for output (as listed
by the
.Fl l
flag).
The default is device 0.
.It Fl f Ar file
Specifies the name of the sequencer device.
.It Fl l
List the possible devices without playing anything.
.It Fl m
Show MIDI file meta events (copyright, lyrics, etc.).
.It Fl q
Do not play the MIDI file, just parse it.
.It Fl t Ar tempo
Specifies the tempo.
Default is 100.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
If the flag is repeated, the verbosity increases.
.It Fl x
Play a small sample sound.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/music

.El
.\".Sh ENVIRONMENT
.\".Bl -tag -width MIDIDEVICE
.\".It Pa AUDIOCTLDEVICE
.\"the audio control device to use.
.\".El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr midi 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Nx 1.4 .
Support for RMID files was added in
.Mx 8 .
.Sh BUGS
It may take a long while before playing stops when
.Nm
is interrupted since the sequencer and MIDI buffers will still
be emptied.
