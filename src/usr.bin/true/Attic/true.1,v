@• more comment and int→bool cleanup, add and improve some comments
• in interactive mode, always look up {LC_{ALL,CTYPE},LANG} environment
  variables if setlocale/nl_langinfo(CODESET) doesn’t suffice
• add the ability to call any builtin (some don't make sense or wouldn't
  work) directly by analysing argv[0]
• for direct builtin calls, the {LC_{ALL,CTYPE},LANG} environment
  variables determine utf8-mode, even if MKSH_ASSUME_UTF8 was set
• when called as builtin, echo behaves POSIXish
• add domainname as alias for true on MirBSD only, to be able to link it
• sync mksh Makefiles with Build.sh output
• adjust manpage wrt release plans
• link some things to mksh now that we have callable builtins:
  bin/echo bin/kill bin/pwd bin/sleep (exact matches)
  bin/test bin/[ (were scripts before)
  bin/domainname=usr/bin/true usr/bin/false (move to /bin/ now)
• drop linked utilities and, except for echo and kill, their manpages
• adjust instbin and link a few more there as well
