.Nd compact disc control utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cdio
.Op Fl sv
.Oo Fl d Ar host :
.Ar port Oc
.Op Fl f Ar device
.Op Ar command args ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is a compact disc control utility,
with support for playing audio CDs and TAO CD writing.
.Pp
If no command is given,
.Nm
enters interactive mode, reading commands from the standard input.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Fl d
.Ar host : Ns Ar port
.Xc
Specifies a CDDB host
.Bq default: freedb.freedb.org:cddb .
.It Fl f Ar device
Specifies the name of the CD device, such as
.Pa /dev/rcd0c
or
.Pa mcd0 .
Both absolute and relative paths to
.Pa /dev
filenames are possible;
the raw partition name is added if needed.
.It Fl s
Silent mode.
Do not print table headers or human-readable comments.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
A second occurence of
.Fl v
causes even more information to be printed.
.El
.Pp
The available commands are listed below.
Only as many characters as are required to uniquely identify a command
need be specified.
If no command is given,
only a track number or range,
then
.Ic play
is assumed.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic blank
Minimally blank the disc.
.It Ic cddbinfo Op Ar n
Print the Table Of Contents (TOC) after matching the disc with the CDDB.
In case of multiple matches, reissue the command with
.Ar n .
.It Ic cdid
Print the disc ID that will be used for matching with the CDDB.
.It Ic cdplay Op Ar track1-trackN ...
Play specified tracks from disk.
Unlike
.Ic play ,
the CD player need not be connected to an audio device;
instead it rips tracks from disk and outputs audio data to
the default
.Xr audio 4
device or
.Xr aucat 1
socket.
Both individual tracks and track ranges may be specified.
If range is specified in descending order tracks will be played in descending order.
If the first value in the range is omitted, tracks from first track on disk to the specified one will be played.
If the last value in the range is omitted, tracks from the specified track to the last track on disk will be played.
.It Ic cdrip Op Ar track1-trackN ...
Rip specified tracks from disk.
Audio tracks are saved as WAVE sound files.
All tracks will be saved in the current working directory.
If parameters are omitted, all tracks are ripped.
Both individual tracks and track ranges may be specified, in the same format as the
.Ic cdplay
command.
.It Ic close
Inject the disc.
.It Ic debug Ar on | off
Enable/disable the debugging mode of the CD device driver.
.It Ic device Ar devname
Make
.Ar devname
the current CD device.
This is the equivalent of quitting
.Nm
and restarting with a different device.
.It Ic eject
Eject the disc.
.It Ic exit
A synonym for
.Ic quit .
.It Ic help
Print the list of available commands.
.It Ic info
Print the Table Of Contents (TOC).
If
.Fl v
is also specified,
the current features and current profile is printed.
If
.Fl v
is specified twice,
the complete list of supported profiles
and a hex dump of each current feature is printed.
.It Ic lock
Lock the drive door, preventing it from being opened manually.
The lock is only in effect during run time of
.Nm ,
and can be rescinded with, for example, the
.Ic eject
command.
.It Ic next
Play the next track.
If we're at the last track, stop.
.It Ic pause
Stop playing.
Do not stop the disc.
.It Xo Ic play
.Oo Ar track1 Ns Op Ar .index1
.Op Ar track2 Ns Op Ar .index2 Oc
.Xc
Play from
.Ar track1
to
.Ar track2 ;
an optional index point can be specified for each track.
If only one track is specified, play from that track to the end of the disc.
If no tracks are specified, play the whole disc.
.It Xo Ic play

.Ar s2
in seconds,
frame number
.Ar f2 .
If a track number is specified
.Pq tr Ns Ar X ,
then the minutes, seconds, and frame numbers
are relative to the start of that track.
Minutes are in the range 0\(en99.
Seconds are in the range 0\(en59.
Frame numbers are in the range 0\(en74.
.It Ic play Op Ar #block Op Ar len
