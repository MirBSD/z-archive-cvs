.Sh NAME
.Nm splitb
.Nd split a file bytewise into pieces
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dhkq
.Op Fl B Ar bufsiz
.Op Fl b Ar blocksize
.Op Fl t Ar template
.Op Fl w Ar width
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads the given
.Ar file
(or from standard input, if no file is specified)
and breaks it into smaller files at defined byte boundaries.
.Pp
The operation of
.Nm
is controlled by the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl B Ar bufsiz
Set the size of the buffer to
.Ar bufsiz .
Default is 1048576 (1 MiB).
.It Fl b Ar blocksize
Set the size of the file to
.Ar blocksize
buffers of
.Ar bufsiz
each.
Default is 1.
.It Fl d
Toggle the use of decimal respective sedecimal sequence numbers.
Default is sedecimal.
.It Fl h
Display a verbose synopsis.
.It Fl k
Set
.Ar bufsiz
to 1024 (1 KiB).
.It Fl q
Be quiet during operation.
.It Fl t Ar template
Specify pathname which is prepended to generated files.
Default is
.Dq split .
.Ar template
is followed by a dot and three
.Ns ( Ar width )
sedecimal numbers (000-FFF) as sequence number; if more than 4096
(16^3) files are to be generated, it simply runs off unless the
.Fl w
option is used.
.It Fl w Ar width
Specify the number of sedecimal digits to append,
in the range from 1 to
.Dv PATH_MAX \- 2 \- Fn strlen template .
Default is 3.
.El
.Pp
An additional argument specified is used as the name
