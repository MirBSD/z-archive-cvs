.Sh NAME
.Nm encrypt
.Nd encrypt passwords from the command line or standard input
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm encrypt
.Fl b Ar rounds
.Op Fl p | Ar string
.Nm encrypt
.Op Fl c Ar class
.Op Fl p | Ar string
.Nm encrypt
.Fl m
.Op Fl p | Ar string
.Nm encrypt
.Fl S Ar salt
.Op Fl p | Ar string

.Fl s Ar salt
.Op Fl p | Ar string
.Nm encrypt
.Fl k
.Nm makekey
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
prints the encrypted form of
.Ar string
to the standard output.
This is mostly useful for encrypting passwords from within scripts.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xbxrounds
.It Fl k
Run in
.Nm makekey
compatible mode; a single combined key and salt are read from standard
input and the DES encrypted result is written to standard output without a
terminating newline.
.It Fl b Ar rounds
Encrypt the string using Blowfish hashing with the specified
.Ar rounds .
.It Fl c Ar class
Use the cipher type specified in the given user login class.
See
.Xr login.conf 5
for more information.
.It Fl m
Encrypt the string using MD5.
.It Fl p
Prompt for a single string with echo turned off.
.It Fl S Ar salt
Encrypt the string with the specified
.Ar salt ,
using the algorithm specified by
.Ar salt .
.It Fl s Ar salt
Encrypt the string using DES, with the specified
.Ar salt .
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar string
is specified,
.Nm
reads one string per line from standard input, encrypting each one
with the chosen algorithm from above.
In the case where no specific algorithm or specific user login class was given
as a command line option, the algorithm specified in the default class in
.Pa /etc/login.conf
will be used.
.Pp
For MD5 and Blowfish as well as any algorithm determined from the login
.Ar class ,
a new random salt is automatically generated for each password, except if the
.Fl S
option is used.
.Pp
Specifying the
.Ar string
on the command line should be discouraged; using the
standard input is more secure.
