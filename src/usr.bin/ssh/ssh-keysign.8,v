.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ssh-keysign
.Nd ssh helper program for hostbased authentication
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used by
.Xr ssh 1
to access the local host keys and generate the digital signature
required during hostbased authentication with SSH protocol version 2.
.Pp
.Nm
is disabled by default and can only be enabled in the
global client configuration file
.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_config
by setting
.Cm EnableSSHKeysign
to
.Dq yes .
.Pp
.Nm
is not intended to be invoked by the user, but from
.Xr ssh 1 .
See
.Xr ssh 1
and
.Xr sshd 8
for more information about hostbased authentication.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_config
Controls whether
.Nm
is enabled.
.It Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key, /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
These files contain the private parts of the host keys used to
generate the digital signature.
They should be owned by root, readable only by root, and not
accessible to others.
Since they are readable only by root,
.Nm
must be set-uid root if hostbased authentication is used.
