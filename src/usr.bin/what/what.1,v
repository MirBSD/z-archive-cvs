@simplify: skip looking for RCS IDs, just look for SCCS IDs, since we
embed the RCS IDs with an SCCS tag now, and it hasn't worked anyway,
because it was looking for $MirBSD: $ tags...

.Sh NAME
.Nm what
.Nd "show what versions of object modules were used to construct a file"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm what
.Op Fl s
.Op Ar file Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads each
.Ar file
and searches for sequences of the form
.Dq \&@@(#)
as inserted by the source code control system.
It prints the remainder
of the string following this marker, up to a NUL, newline, double
quote, backslash, or
.Ql >
character.
.Pp
If the
.Fl s
option is specified, only the first occurrence of an identification string in
each file is printed.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with a return value of 0 if any identification strings were found,
or with a return value of 1 otherwise.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is expected to be a superset of the
.St -p1003.1
specification.
In
.Mx 5
and up, the ability to operate on standard input is restored.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
.Sh BUGS
As
.Bx
is not licensed to distribute
.Tn SCCS ,
this is a rewrite of the
.Nm
command which is part of
.Tn SCCS .
As such it may not behave exactly the same as that
command does.

Since
.Ox 3.4 ,
the ability of the
.Nm
utility to operate on stdin was removed for
.St -p1003.1
compliance.
In
.Mx ,
the old behaviour is retained, and the
.Nm
version in
.Mx 5
and up is not
.St -p1003.1
compliant.
