.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays a simple calendar.
If arguments are not specified,
the current month is displayed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl j
Display Julian dates (days one-based, numbered from January 1).
.It Fl y
Display a calendar for the current year.
.El
.Pp
A single parameter specifies the year (1 - 9999) to be displayed;
note the year must be fully specified:
.Dq Li cal 89
will
.Em not
display a calendar for 1989.
Two parameters denote the month (1 - 12) and year.
If no parameters are specified, the current month's calendar is
displayed.
.Pp
A year starts on January 1st.
.Pp
The Gregorian Reformation is assumed to have occurred in 1752 after the 2nd
of September.
By this time, most countries had recognized the reformation (although a
few did not recognize it until the early 1900's).
Eleven days following that date were eliminated by the reformation, so the
calendar for that month is a bit unusual.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
command offers a superset of
.St -p1003.2
functionality.
