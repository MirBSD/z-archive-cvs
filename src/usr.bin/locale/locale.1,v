When
.Nm
is invoked with arguments and no options specified it will print out
.Em keyword Ns No 's
value determined using current locale settings.

The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Write names of all available locales.
On
.Mx ,
this is hard-coded.
.It Fl c
Write the category name for the selected keywords.
.It Fl k
Write the name and value of the selected keywords.
.It Fl m
Write names of all available charmaps.
On
.Mx ,
this is hard-coded.

While looking for locales
.Nm
will respect the
.Ev PATH_LOCALE
environment variable, and use it instead of the system default
locale directory.

.Nx
does not support

in their
.Em POSIX
meaning
.Nm
emulates the
.Fl m
option via CODESETs listing of all available locales.
