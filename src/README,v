@$MirOS: src/README,v 1.6 2007/03/02 05:55:11 tg Exp $

This is the MirOS base BSD derived operating system,
kernel and userland, by The MirOS Project – http://mirbsd.de/

MirOS BSD is structured as follows:
 * MirOS BSD kernel: sys/ kern/
    A BSD-licenced uniprocessor operating system kernel
    for i386 (and amd64 in 32-bit mode) and (32-bit) sparc CPUs
 * MirOS userland: bin/ include/ lib/ libexec/ sbin/ usr.bin/ usr.sbin/
   and supplemental information: etc/ share/
    A BSD-licenced or similar userland for the MirOS BSD
    and other UNIX®-like operating system kernels
 * MirOS non-free section: gnu/
    Software which is part of the MirOS userland but not
    as freely licenced as the BSD heritage (e.g. GNU, Sendmail, Perl)
 * MirOS release engineering: distrib/ scripts/
    Tools for creating a formal MirOS release

MirOS userland is not entirely self-hosted: the C compiler is
missing. MirBSD currently uses the GNU Compiler Collection,
which is not Ⓕ Copyfree (there are licencing implications on
some run-time libraries, and the documentation is covered by
the GFDL) or fits into the goal of being a small, contemporary
operating system. That’s why GCC is not part of MirOS base,
but contributed on the same media with it.

There is no code for an implementation of the X-Windowing
System either; XFree86™ is contributed similarily to gcc,
but only for size and practical reasons, since it's free.

Licencing information can be found in /usr/share/doc/legal/
after installation. Wir sind verpeilt und garantieren nichts;
wer unsere Releases verwendet, ist selber schuld. Mittlerweile
sind wir eh’ ein „rolling release“-System.

@some updates; simplify collective-work copyright; no longer require
copyright assignment to the FSF for gnu/gcc changes (but encourage
getting our patches merged upstream), prepare to merge whatever we
still use from gcc into core/gnu; some text on PD-marked stuff

MirOS userland is not entirely self-hosted: the C compiler
is missing. MirOS currently uses the GNU Compiler Collection,
which cannot entirely be built using tools from MirOS itself
(most notably, the Ada compiler needs itself to build, and the
whole thing wants GNU make) nor is it free enough (there are
licencing implications on some run-time libraries, and the
documentation is covered by the GFDL) or fits into the goal
of being a small, modern operating system. That's why gcc is
not part of MirOS, but contributed on the same media with it.

documentation is licenced under the GNU FDL, which prevents
us from redistributing it) or fits into the project's goal
a29 9
GNU binutils, however, are part of MirOS. For more practical
reasons, their documentation is included with the base MirOS
installation, covered by the terms of the GNU FDL which are
not free enough to meet our goals. Since it is practically
impossible to remove the documentation and provide it as an
external file without losing maintainability, we have chosen
this compromise, following the Debian project's compromise
for releasing Debian 3.1 timely.
