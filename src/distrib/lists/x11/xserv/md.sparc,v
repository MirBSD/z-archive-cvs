log
@clean up the hysterical raisin mess that the X11 dist set lists are,
some from us, some inherited from OgreBSD:
• all /etc/** stuff is now in xetc*.ngz, no matter if constant or conffile
• all fonts are in the new xfont*.ngz set
• everything else is either in xbase*.ngz or (regular+DMX, nested+VFB,
  print) server stuff in xserv*.ngz (renamed from xsrv*.ngz)
