log
@disable gcj by default again - sorry lads, but I get hardware issues
(I think) with it, when not heavily underclocking my build laptop it
segfaults (ICE) in libjava.

add instructions to top of mircvs://gcc/Makefile.lang how to enable.

agreed bsiegert@@ after some discussions
focusing on getting the release out soon and especially stable

@• move some non-DFSG/OSD-compliant stuff to a new distset “unfree”;
  shuffle some other stuff around – I hope I've estimated the terms
  on the files correctly… (htman stuff isn't separated like this as
  it's never installed)
