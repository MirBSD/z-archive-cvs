1.1
log
@I promised «Jordan_U:#grml» our next version would have support for the
boot method via /boot/grub/loopback.cfg – voilà (untested)

In MirOS bsd4grml, all options except chaining to GRUB are available.
In MirOS bsd4me, the install and baselive images, only the standard
bootloader prompt going to the installer is available, although the
command line gives support for e.g. switching to serial console.
