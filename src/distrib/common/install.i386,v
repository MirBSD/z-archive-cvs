You will now create a single MBR partition to contain the disklabel. This
partition must have an id of 27; must *NOT* overlap other partitions; and must
be marked as the only active partition. You can create other MBR partitions,
primary or extended ones, to contain the filesystems, but these must *NOT* be
of type 27, A6, A5 or A9. It is recommended they be of type DB (CP/M-86), and
they are only used to mark the space as USED for other operating systems that
still need MBR partitions. BSD exclusively uses the data in the disklabel to
determine where filesystems are, and uses the MBR partition exclusively to
determine where on the disk the disklabel is positioned.

The 'manual' command describes all the fdisk commands in detail.

$(fdisk ${_disk})
__EOT
	fdisk -e ${_disk}

	cat <<__EOT
Here is the partition information you chose:

$(fdisk ${_disk})
__EOT
}

md_prep_disklabel() {
	typeset _disk=$1

	md_prep_fdisk $_disk

	cat <<__EOT

You will now create an MirBSD disklabel inside the MirBSD MBR partition.
The disklabel defines how MirBSD splits up the whole disc into slices
in which filesystems and swap space are created and other operating
systems' filesystems are mapped.

The offsets used in the disklabel are ABSOLUTE, i.e. relative to the
start of the disk, NOT the start of the MirBSD MBR partition. If you
have created a split space, i.e. one partition of type 27 and one or
more partitions of type (e.g.) DB, use b<return>0<return>*<return>
to enable using the entire disk for MirBSD. Be sure to create slices
mapping all other operating systems' filesystems to not overwrite them.

@_much_ simplify the console situation: instead of ttyC0 use console for
wscons too, users should use ttyC1 and up to login if they want a wsvt*
type preselected (like we had before already); removes the need to edit
/etc/ttys if switching between serial console and wsdisplay console and
makes all the stuff less arch-dependent. part 1 of the master plan.
