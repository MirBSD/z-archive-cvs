@help serial console users even more (for now; this might become a two-stage
menu later, and cdrom10.iso must be touched too; maybe we can even grab the
port from the combios/tinybios control… who knows)

anyway, we weren't the first BSD with a live CD, we probably were the first
with a live HDD, and we definitively are the first OS with a live CF card ☻
