@							MirOS#9 BSD/i386

Setup CD for MirOS/i386
=======================

This CD provides you with the standard MirOS GENERIC kernel as well as a
small ramdisk image. You can install or upgrade a MirOS installation and
do some basic repair tasks. Also included are some useful tools, for ex-
ample an ssh client and server facilitating remote control.

If you are reading this text from the Live/Install CD instead of the 5MB
Mini-ISO image, you will be presented a textual menu interface with four
entries at boot asking you (to be selected via their number or by cursor
keys) whether you want to proceed to the traditional bootloader, run the
Live CD or directly start the Setup programme. Note: formal release ISOs
are never Live CDs because of their multi-architecture capabilities.

For further information on how to set up MirOS, please go to our website
at http://MirBSD.de/ and read the installation documents.


Hardware notes
==============

If you encounter boot problems...
... try 'boot -c' and 'disable pcibios'
... disable "IDE Prefetch" in the BIOS
... disable apm in UKC ('boot -c')
... disable ehci, ohci and uhci (USB) in UKC
... use 'change pcibios' and set flags to something else (e.g. 0x40)


About MirOS BSD
===============

What is MirBSD?
---------------

MirBSD is not a project or stand-alone product but rather defined as the
contents of _my_ /usr/src and /usr/ports directories. I am Thorsten "mi-
rabile" Glaser, nice to meet you. I hope I can be of help to you, by ma-
king this project available to the general public.

What am I instaling then?
-------------------------

This is MirOS BSD, a community-developed successor of MirBSD®, developed
by a few individuals around the world (mostly Europe but also Canada and
the rest of America). MirOS is compliant to the Open Source Definition.

If this is a boot image for a MirOS development snapshot, just boot from
the CD and start hacking. Please be sure to report problems and consider
to send unified diffs for stuff you fixed.

If this is a formal release, the directory in which you are reading this
file also contains checksums of the installation sets (*ngz) and kernels
(bsd*). You can check them from within the installation. Check the vali-
dity of the signatures on the checksum with a hash tool and gzsig(1).

Live CD
-------

This edition of the MirBSD Live/Install CD is an early beta issue. There
most likely be bugs, so beware. Note: the formal MirOS releases do *not*
contain the Live CD functionality.

As a new feature, you can 'cat' or 'dd' either the whole CD-ROM, or just
the 5MB Mini-ISO (./v9/i386/cdrom8.iso), on your hard disc (/dev/hda, on
GNU/Linux, or /dev/rwd0c, on MirOS) and run it from there. Note this de-
stroys your partition table and any other installed operating systems. A
specific hack for serial console users will be added later. (Currently a
live CD does not work when dd'd onto a hard disc. No idea, why.)

the possibility of such damage or existence of a nontrivial bug.


To the maximum extent of my knowledge, MirBSD is free for non-com-
mercial and commercial use as well as non-commercial redistributi-
on; redistribution of several parts of the system require additio-
nal arrangements, such as supplying the source code with redistri-
butions.  Some parts of the system are covered by different licen-
ces, such as the GNU GPL, LGPL, the ASF and Sendmail license.  You
are responsible by yourself to read and comply with these terms if
you intend redistribution. To the maximum extent of our knowledge,
MirOS is free from code that is intended to do damage or infringes
third parties' rights, although due to the implied error-proneness
and complexity of software, as well as the sheer size of the MirOS
operating environment and MirPorts framework, code can be mis-used
so usage of MirOS/MirPorts is at your own risk.

that directory, to find out about other strings attached with MirOS.

Some of the supplied software is covered by GNU licences. The source
code is available at http://www.mirbsd.org/ and its mirrors; further
