@spelling cleanup: “programme” is distinct from “program”; even in
British English, the latter is used for computer programs, while
the former serves for things like the TV programme, or a programme
to plant trees

@use mksh realpath builtin instead of readlink -f for canonicalisation

note: there’s still a readlink(1) call left in, for instance, mirmake;
this does not hurt because we initially assumed that readlink(1) does
exist anyway and bundled ours just because some do not have the ‘-f’
option for realpath(2)isation

@big fat licence update (I left some which are bsiegert@@'s alone though)
also, remove licence boilerplate from some .h files who don't deserve it
and remove and add some advertising clauses because I say so

@in shell, readlink(2) is "readlink -f $something", and
MUCH better than "(cd $something;pwd)" in all respects
including trimming trailing /.// stuff
